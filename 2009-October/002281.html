+Timeline
+========
+
+* turn play button into a toggle button
+
+* animation export:
+ 
+  - exported animation doesn't need layers, but layers could still be
+    useful for later editing
+
+  - might not need a navgraph
+
+  - needs all objects
+
+  - what happens with the animation before the start and after the
+    end? does it persist or disappear?
+
+  - exported animation must be almost complete SectorModels
+
+  - recursive animation is needed, i.e. animation that contains other
+    animations
+
+  - exported animation basically is a full SectorModel, there is no
+    easy way around that
+
+  - could share a SectorModel shared_ptr between two tabs, thus
+    editing animation in one, previewing in another, would need a way
+    to handle change events
+
+* need a way to edit keyframes instead of just inserting new ones
+
+* implement load of timeline
+
+* using UI manager doesn't work when toolbar is  on the Notepad
+
+* add ability to scale selections
+
+* add ability to set FPS
+
+* some timelines, such as Vector2f stuff could be visualized by graphics in the scene
+
+* add snappping to frame borders (i.e. no float, but just well defined int positions)
+
+* make snapping optional, add a button for it
+
+* add scrolling (middle button and scrollbars)
+
+* add overlap-avoidance
+
+Animation Subsystem
+===================
+
+* animation objects bundle the pointers to objects along with
+  curves that describe changes to those objects
+
+* curves can manipulate all kinds of properties of an object, such as:
+
+  - rotation
+  - position
+  - color
+  - ...
+
+* curves can also used to start or stop an object, for example a curve
+  for a movie-object might have actions such as:
+
+  - start
+  - stop
+  - reset
+  - set_pos()
+
+  That can be placed on a curve
+
+* there is no global timeline, timelines are local to an animation object
+
+* animation objects can be recursive, i.e. an animation object might
+  start other animation objects
+
+* there are two core types of animation objects:
+
+  - prefab animations that are saved to their own files and only
+    linked into the scene, they provide their own objects
+
+  - plain animations that are part of the main scene, they can
+    manipulate any object in the scene
+
+* two animation objects can access the same objects for animation, but
+  not at the same time as that would cause glitching (i.e. you might
+  have a door-open.anim and a door-close.anim)
+
+* ignore tweens for now and implement the basics first
+
+* implement load/save for timeline
+
+* make timeline proper part of Document and SectorModel
+
+High Priority
+=============
+
+* add a GenericObjectModel to the editor that just stores all the
+  information in the FileReader and writes it out again, use it for
+  all objects whose type isn't known by the editor
+
+  * implement a way to clone a FileReader, keep it and pass it to FileWriter
+  
+  * simply implement a way to serialize a FileReader to string and
+    write that out with FileWriter
+
+* enhance the ObjectSelector to allow different object types (particle
+  systems, highlight, light, etc)
+
+* implement objects properties in a generic fashion:
+
+  GenericDialogBox::add_int(const std::string&amp; name, const boost::function&lt;void (int)&gt;&amp; callback);
+  GenericDialogBox::add_enum(const std::string&amp; name, const boost::function&lt;void (int)&gt;&amp; callback);
+  GenericDialogBox::add_string(const std::string&amp; name, const boost::function&lt;void (int)&gt;&amp; callback);
+
+  * apply changes instantly
+  * use the Undo/Redo system
+
 Editor Restructuring
 ====================
 
+* 'delete layer' should set the layer selection to something valid
+
+* add a toggleable safe-area overlay that shows how much fits on a screen
+
 * SceneGraph needs to be updated while drag&amp;drop is in progress
 
 * delete/remove/erase naming is a bit mixed up in a few places

 * add special drawing for different edge types (i.e. draw stairs for stair type edges)
 
-* add grid snapping to navgraph
+* snapping for navgraph is limited to moving the object, should also
+  work when creating the nodes in the first place
 
-* moving a NavGraphNodeModel snaps the bounding box to the grid, while
-  it should snap the center point
-
 * horizontal/vertical navgraph edges are near impossible to select
   (bounding box is just 1px height)
