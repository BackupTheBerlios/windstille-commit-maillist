-While I don't really care about class and variable naming as long as it's consistent. I'd like to not have to put curly braces on an own line and indent them separately (I don't know if vim supports that and other IDEs will shoke on it probably as well). I'd propose a more java like indenting of braces (with 4 space or tab indentation):
-
-{{{
-void
-ClassName::do_stuff_method(int blup)
-{
-    int a = 20;
-
-    // the following will do an insanely complicated calculation
-    for(int i = 0; i &lt; (a + 3); ++i) {
-        std::cout &lt;&lt; i * a &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
-
-        // don't forget to skip some elements
-        if(!i)
-             continue;
-
-        switch(a) {
-            case 5:
-                std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;5&quot;;
-                break;
-            case 6:

-I know this is a pain, but would it be possible to do (nightly? weekly?) development builds?  I'm not working with the source much, so I just want to get a feel of where the game is at.  As grumbel said, the script should be written for the gameplay, and not vice-versa.

-I think this is a bad idea. The script might be important but actually writing the game requires 100 times more work. I think the more people taking the time to get the game to compile (perhaps finding and fixing minor bugs in the process), the better. If you can do some coding work whilst you are there, even better. Also, I'm pretty sure you meant to say &quot;the gameplay should be written for the script, and not vice versa&quot;, as what you did say implies the script is unimportant, which I don't think you meant.

-Actually, I meant what I said.  IIRC, in my last conversation with grumbel, he said it's our primary priority to make sure that the gameplay is fun: we should write a plot that fits in with the gameplay, whatever that may be, instead of creating gameplay around a plot.

-Actually you need to focus on both, can't have gameplay without some story and neither story without having any idea of gameplay. The important part is that it is fun and therefore gameplay and story need to go hand in hand. About the nightly builds, don't really think they are necessary, physfs and OpenAL should come with your distro, Squirrel is integrated into the source and ClanLib is also just a './configure &amp;&amp; make' away. And after that its just a matter of regularly 'svn update &amp;&amp; jam'.

-I like the story part from quickflash that Jane is getting bored about mining with 21 and starts modifying her suit in free time. Also the competitor being her sister might be interesting.
-
-I also like the part from pifactorial about boss having a mining company at first that gets &quot;overtaken&quot; once the non loyal worker gave the codes away. Though I'd simply change the ending so that boss starts a new business new with his money left. No need to have a too strong relation between Jane and Boss (which would be the case with boss being bankcrupt and Jane being the only one staying with him).

-Regarding the story, one idea I haven't seen mentioned yet at all anywhere on this wiki or in the IRC meeting logs (I may have missed it) is having a native race on the mining planet.
-
-So far, we have a mining planet/moon that has basically been taken over by a bunch of corporations for mining purposes. Wouldn't it be more interesting if there was already a peaceful (or even not so peaceful) human race on the planet? It is kind of clich&eacute;d, but it would make for a good source of conflict and could create some very interesting characters.

-&lt;&lt;ind:1&gt;&gt;
-I don't like the idea of a native race because it would completely change the background dynamic - it's not like you can say &quot;This is a mining planet, oh and there just happen to be some aliens there too&quot;. If we discover aliens in a few hundred years time (when this story is set), I don't think they will be so common that having a few aliens who just happen to live on one of our (Earth's) mining planets is going to be a minor oh-by-the-way thing, it would end up dominating the storyline.

-I never meant it to be a &quot;plop-in&quot; thing on the side. You're right that it would be a very big (or at least important) part of the storyline. I think this would really help drive the story, especially as far as character development goes. 
-The first thing that comes to mind for story is this: There are two main &quot;groups&quot;. The natives of the planet who are basically being taken over and the corporations who are &quot;taking over&quot; the natives so that they can exploit their resources. The natives would have an underground resistance that's trying to take back their planet. Jane is working for the corporations and ends up having moral issues and ends up [eventually] helping the resistance. The Boss might even agree with Jane and help her out, but his/her involvement in the resistance would be very secretive and only through Jane.
-Anyway, that last paragraph was just a suggestion. I'm sure others (like the ones that already posted their ideas on the [[Ideas]] page can come up with something a little better; possibly sticking a little closer to the current suggestions, too.

-Isn't this a little... sexist?

-
-&lt;&lt;ind:1&gt;&gt;I totally disagree with the &quot;sexist&quot; point. The fact that most games don't feature any women at all, or if they do then they are just a person to be rescued/read out announcements/whatever, is considerably more sexist, or at least stupid. I can't see how you can complain about a game that features a female character in the lead role, and a lead role which involves fighting/being hurt/acting like a normal person. How on earth is allowing a female character to be hurt on a dangerous mission trivialising violence against women? Should Jane be at home looking after children instead? -- [[User:James Gregory|James Gregory]] 12:35, 25 Nov 2005 (CET)&lt;&lt;/ind&gt;&gt;
-
-&lt;&lt;ind:2&gt;&gt;I had three specific points, mentioned above. I could clarify them if you want. I wanted to raise a discussion around this topic while it's still early enough in the process to do so. Of course I don't mind having female characters in the game. I don't think the original ''Metroid'' games are sexist, while maybe ''Super Mario 64'' is. &quot;Dear Mario, I have baked a cake for you...&quot; I don't want to fight or argue, but this is an important topic for many people. I perceived the phrasing '''as written''' -- ''&quot;Cutscene of Jane getting hit/bitten whatever and getting wounding and then dragging herself to the next opening in the forest to be found by the shuttle.&quot;'' -- to trivialize violence against women. YMMV but it concerned me enough so that I'd want to bring it up for discussion. [[User:Sunnan|Sunnan]] 05:44, 26 Nov 2005 (CET)&lt;&lt;/ind&gt;&gt;
-
-&lt;&lt;ind:3&gt;&gt;* it is standard practice in English to refer to a person of unknown gender as &quot;he&quot;. Furthermore, 99.99% of the people who play open source computer games are male, so referring to the player as &quot;he&quot; doesn't seem particularly strange. I am aware some authors purposefully use &quot;she&quot; to refer to someone of unknown gender just to challenge convention or whatever, that's fine by me but it's hardly a requirement.&lt;&lt;/ind&gt;&gt;
-
-&lt;&lt;ind:4&gt;&gt;In this particular case it looks more weird than usual since the character's female.&lt;&lt;/ind&gt;&gt;
-
-&lt;&lt;ind:3&gt;&gt;* if the sentence said &quot;Cutscene of Bob getting hit/bitten whatever and getting wounded and then dragging himself to the next opening in the forest to be found by the shuttle&quot; would that be trivialising violence against men? Computer games trivialise violence in general - most games use subject matter of wars, fighting, shooting, etc to provide entertainment - but there is nothing sexist about this.&lt;&lt;/ind&gt;&gt;
-
-&lt;&lt;ind:4&gt;&gt;Yes, it would be trivializing violence against men, and perhaps it would be as much of a problem. I happened to read the writing as nonchalant and uncaring. Perhaps that was not the intention. I see one difference, though. The majority of the violence performed in contemporary civilization seems to be performed by men. (The majority of the victims are male, too.) That's why violence is sometimes seen as a feminist issue. YMMV, of course. I get a knee-jerk reaction when I see violence against women brushed of as &quot;whatever&quot; -- you may have other reactions, or similar reactions to other issues.&lt;&lt;/ind&gt;&gt;
-
-&lt;&lt;ind:3&gt;&gt;* the shower scene doesn't feature any nakedness. People coming out of showers is a standard situation in TV and films, and not just those aimed at men. Earlier discussion ended with a general conclusion that a marginally soap-opera-esque feel to the plot might work well, and soap operas feature plenty of people coming out of showers. Are soap operas sexist? -- [[User:James Gregory|James Gregory]] 16:54, 26 Nov 2005 (CET)&lt;&lt;/ind&gt;&gt;
-
-&lt;&lt;ind:4&gt;&gt;Nakedness in itself doesn't have to a problem. It's the (seemingly) gratuitous sexualization that has to be handled with care so it doesn't become de-humanizing. Lara Croft could've been such a cool heroine. Instead, she was reduced to a male masturbation fantasy. &quot;Are soap operas sexist?&quot; Yes. I perceive most of them as very sexist. [[User:Sunnan|Sunnan]] 01:12, 29 Nov 2005 (CET)&lt;&lt;/ind&gt;&gt;
-
-&lt;&lt;ind:0&gt;&gt;(Oh, and one more thing -- I know this isn't supposed to be a clone, but one thing I did enjoy with ''Metroid'', ''Another World'' and ''Prince of Persia'' was that the game play was revealed gradually, not through a tutorial mode. Yes, ''Another World'' is tough, but it's not tough because you don't know how the controls work -- it's tough because you don't know what to do, in what order to shoot things, and because you have to have lightning timing. --Sunnan, again.)&lt;&lt;/ind&gt;&gt;

-Support for multiple sectors for the start simply means to implement a &lt;tt&gt;GameSession::set_sector(Sector* sector)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;GameSession::set_sector(const std::string&amp; sector)&lt;/tt&gt; function and probally insert some code into the doors to handle the sector switch. Later on we might need a SectorManager or so that keeps track of the state of a sector, so that the sector doesn't get completly reset once you leave and reenter.

-I don't think the color is worth to care about, in some situations its even changed per vertex, so changing it per DrawingRequest shouldn't hurt much, what might be of much more importance is the used texture. Texture switches should be reducable a lot by when more surfaces are packaged to a single texture.
-
-Another thing that is very important is to figure out which DrawingRequests need sorting and which don't. While all our textures are RGBA, except those used for the 3d models, many of them only really need one bit-alpha, so with a correctly set glAlphaFunc() it should be possible to draw them out of order by using the z-buffer. Additive blended surfaces might be drawn out of order as well, even so only after all solid ones.
