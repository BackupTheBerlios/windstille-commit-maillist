-! The Garden Of Time
-!! by Ingo Ruhnke &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/windstille-commit">grumbel at gmx.de</A>&gt;
-
-A little noice, some sparks, then suddenly a flash of light. Belvedere
-was out cold, unconsciousness and he couldn't move. Took him hours to
-regain concisousness, maybe days, he couldn't remember. He couldn't
-remember anything to be precise, only his name. Looking at his clothes
-he could see that he must have been throught a lot, shreds hanging
-down from his body, skin below slightly burned, little was left
-intact. From what was left from his cloths he could tell that it must
-have been a white coat not to long ago, but it didn't give him much
-further hint on what happened. His legs still didn't have much feel in
-them, but it was time to get up, he has been down on the ground for
-long enough. It was time to move and find out what exactly happened,
-so he grabed all the strength that was left to pull himself up. But no
-luck, his knees couldn't hold him and he stumbeled back to the
-ground. Things seem to have been worse then expected, but there a
-branch, a thick one looked strong enough that it might hold him. He
-hadn't anything else to do, so he gave it a try. The branch gave him
-the support he needed and so he stood up and looked around. 
-
-What he saw confused him. He couldn't see much when he was on the
-ground, but now he could clearly see, buildings, plenty of them, but
-all rubish. It didn't look like they where damaged by the same force
-that hit him. Sure they where crumbled, but no burns, no scattered
-debri. It looked like those buildings have been brought down by the
-forces of nature over the years. But how could that be, from the looks
-of it he could tell that the buildings where rather new. People
-haven't been buildings things like this a hundred years ago, but that
-must have been how long it took nature to take them down, maybe more,
-he couldn't tell. He wasn't a biologist, so much was sure, but
-everything else was still a blur.
-
-Stumbling around seem to help his legs, feeling slowly got back into
-them. His stick would not be needed much longer. With his newly gained
-mobility he was able to do some more exploring. From what he could
-tell there where around 20 buildings, surrounded by a large wall. The
-wall was though, while nature had eaten large parts away, it still did
-its job, at least for Belvedere. He did a walk all around it, but he
-couldn't find a area where it was damage enough to make it past it,
-especially not with his legs, which still needed some time to get back
-to normal. Trapped where he was he started with a deeper investigation
-into the buildings, maybe they would tell him what happened.
-
-The building in which he woke up was empty, he didn't notice it at
-first, but thinking about it this turned out to be quite unusual. All
-the other buildings contained something. Some just a few chairs and
-tables or what was left of them after all those years. Others
-contained selves and cabinets, those that he had searches so far were
-either empty or just contained food. Rotten long ago.  That wouldn't
-be of much use. But the building in which he wolke up was
-empty. Whatever was in here must have been carried away long ago,
-since there wasn't a trace left of it.
-
-The whole place didn't look to promising, no food, no fresh water,
-except a few muddy puddles. He could survive here a few days, maybe
-some weeks, but he knew that he had to get out of here. Waiting for
-help would have been an option, but given how deserted this place
-looked he didn't have much hope for rescue. While the wall was
-unpassable, every wall needs an opening and so did this one. A large
-gate was there, big and heavy. Would the opening mechanism still work
-after all those years? A try couldn't hurt, but without much suprise
-it soon became all to clear that this gate couldn't be opened by
-normal means, since that would require electronics. He could tell that
-by looking at the wreaked console infront of the gate. While he might
-be able to fix the broken circutry there wasn't a change to get power,
-not here, not after all those years. Even if he would have found an
-generator, fuel would be required, but every fuel container would have
-long rusted away and gave its fuel away.
-
-Disappointed by this discovery he continued his search through all the
-other buildings, this time doing a more detailed sweap. Maybe there
-was something that he didn't spot the first time around and there
-where still a few cabinets left that he hadn't examined. 
-
-His search didn't last long. A rain shower started and those buildings
-with their roofs gone didn't provide much protection, neither did what
-was left of his clothes. He found a building that provided enough
-shalter, it wouldn't keep him warm, but at least it would keep him
-dry. Getting wet here, without a pair of clothes available to change
-wouldn't have been a good thing. 
-
-The rain shower lasted for hours. Night was approaching and without a
-light source he wouldn't be able to see much. His search was over for
-today. He decided to sleep a fit. 
-
-The morning sun dazzled him. It was morning after all. He felt
-good. His legs where back to normal, the stick no longer needed. What
-a good day in this lonely place. His luck didn't last for long
-however. Looking outside he could see that the ground had turned into
-a mudded puddle. That wouldn't be fun to walk in, but he didn't really
-have much choice. And luckily his boots where one of the few pieces of
-clothing that still did their job decently.
-
-He decided to do another walk around the village. The muddy ground
-made the walking hard and tiring, but with his legs back at full
-strength he didn't mind that much. To his supprise the rain seemed to
-have its good side, back at the gate he could see that the rain has
-washed away some dirt that had collected on the walls. He could see a
-plate. His memory was still faint, close to non-existant, but he
-seamed to remember that this was an overright for the opening
-mechanism, used for maintenance. That should help him to get out of
-here. But what would have been a easy task back in civilisation,
-turned out to be a problematic one back here. The panel was secured by
-four screws and his fingernails didn't do much good against dozens of
-years of rust. So he was back to square one. 
-
-Further way into the buildings showed him a few cabinets that he
-couldn't open, they where locked. This time the rust that troubled him
-at the gate would come in handy. With a metalic leg, from what must
-have been a chair he had a lever at hand that should turn out
-useful. It wouldn't help him at the gate, since smashing it against
-the plate would only have mate matters worse, but it would help him
-with the cabinets. A few smashes against a rusty part of the cabine
-gave him an opening into which he could insert his lever. Now all he
-needed was to use all his strength to break the lock. Rust again did
-help him plenty and the cabinet spreng open. 
-
-He screwdriver wasn't anywhere to find, but in all the junk he found
-what looked like a coin, an old an rusty coin, just like everything
-else, but with a little lack it would help him at the gate.
-
-Money can't solve all problems, but this one it did. The coin made a
-good fit into the screws, not a perfect one and he needed quite a few
-tries to get it right, but after half an hour of twidling he managed
-to loose three screws. The fourth one turned out to be more tricky,
-rust had melted away its slot. But he didn't care, levers are always
-useful and so they where here. With three screws loose he was able to
-insert his lever between he plate and the gate. His workforce couldn't
-open it, but his weight did. He balanced himself on the level and
-started to wiggle up and down. A minute later the screw had its last
-day, a crack and it was broken into two and the plate was gone. 
-
-The maintaince opening gave him what he expected, a manual override.
-A wheel in there could be turned to open the door. It took plenty of
-force and another lever use to pull it loose, but after that all it
-needed was time. The gate was huge and heavy, so he needed more then a
-handful of surroundings to get it move. It clearly was build with a
-electrical screwer in mind, but with that missing manual labor would
-do the job. Milimeter by milimeter the gate become to move, hardly
-visible at all, but it did move. Ten minutes later he had opened it
-enough so that he could see through. He spotted a road, or what might
-have been one long ago. The jungle around it at clearly taken it back.
-On the left side he could see another building, as everything else it
-was mostly rubble, but it gave him enough motivation to turning that
-little weel.
-
-It look him a good hour, but finally he had opened the gate enough
-that he could slip through, just barely, but a little squeezing later
-he was free. Out of the village and into the jungle. He expected it,
-but it still dampened his will quite a bit to see it in full. It was
-time to give the building a closer inspection. From the look of it he
-figured it must have been a guard post, after all anything else
-wouldn't make much sense to have outside. Would he be able to find a
-weapon in there after all those years? He didn't have any hope, since
-rust would have made it unusable for sure. But to his suprise he was
-wrong. There was no gun to find, but a knife was left in a drawer. And
-it was still sharp, how could that be? It really wasn't a mystery
-after all. This was a keramik knife, not a metal one. So rust didn't
-have a chance. It was a little dirty, but still sharp enough to cut
-through wood. Down here in the jungle that should be useful.
-
-The road out of the villiage lay clear ahead of him. But since the
-jungle had taken it back it look him quite a while to make it through
-walk on it, but with the knife in his hand cutting through the
-branches was doable. A kilometer down the road his luck however
-ended. The road went over a large river and all that was left of the
-bridge were its pillars. The rest much have fallen into the river ages
-ago and there was no way he could make it past that river right now,
-the tide would have washed him away and left him drowing down the
-river. He didn't want to risk that, at least not right know, there was
-still to much hope left, but hope for what?
-
-He had a small village and a road, but nothing else. The whole place
-was abbandoned for decades, maybe centuries. How could he even have
-ended up in this place? His clothing meant that he wasn't an
-archelogist and there wasn't equiment around for an expedition
-either. So what did he do out here in nomansland?
-
-With the road being not much use for escape, he walked back to the
-village. Not empty handed, since he managed to cut a rope from one of
-the pillars. It wasn't long enough to make it over the river and
-without a way to fix it at the other end that wouldn't have helped
-anyway, but it might turn out useful, after all he didn't really have
-much utilities awailable, so anything that looked useful was worth a
-grab.
-
-The way back wasn't much easier then the way to the bridge, but after
-an hour he made it. Back at home it was time for another round of
-closer inspection. The buildings didn't have much useful in them, that
-much he new. But maybe they had something useful on them. On the
-outside of the wall he found a place where he could attach his
-rope. The wall was worn down enough to give him footing. He climed up
-and was now standing on the wall which gave him a good overview over
-the village. The wall was the highest part of the village after all.
-
-On one building he could spot what might have been antennas or a
-satelite dish, but there was really not much left of it. However what
-was left of it, should be enough to hold a rope. Belvedere decided to
-explore this further. Standing right next to the building he couldn't
-see much of the rubble, so he had to throw his rope blindly. A few
-tries later it seemed to have found hold in the rubble. He really
-wasn't an experinced climber, but the buildings were just as the outer
-wall worn out pretty badly, the small cracks give him footing and he
-made its way up.
-
-The satelite dish was indeed completly destroyed, there wasn't much
-left of it. But under the muddy ground that had collected on the roof
-he saw a little sparkling. He rubbed the mut asside and what he saw
-filled him with joy. Solar pannels, the layer of dirt did a good job
-of conversing them, they weren't good as new, but he could tell that
-they looked good enough to be still usable. He seemed to know his way
-around tech. He broke one of the panels modules free, that should be
-enough to give him a few volt. 
-
-This new power source brought him back into the buildings. There has
-been equipment that he ignored before. A few tablet PCs where laying
-around, but none of them had any power left nor was there a way to
-recharge them. That is where his newly optained solar panel would come
-into place. Would one of the tablets still work? He couldn't tell, but
-he knew that they were rather robust, all the fragile hardware sealed
-in a robust plastic, watertight and prooven against dropping. That
-might have been enough to make it survive all those years. Only a try
-would give a final answer.
-
-His keramik knife did a good job at cutting a few wires that he then
-could use to plug into the tablets. It wasn't the most durable hack,
-but it might be a working one. Now all he needed was light, plenty of
-it. So he walked into the middle of the village. The power indicator
-LED on the tablet sprang on, it gave a faint light. The power was
-there, but not yet enough to boot the panel. He needed more light. But
-where to take that from when the only source he had was natural? It
-took him a minute, but he already walked by the answer a while before.
-
-One of the builings must have been a bathroom or something along the
-lines. It had big mirrors on the wall. He took one of them down. It
-was, like all the other onces, cracked, but he wasn't interested in a
-perfect reflection, just enough light to make his panel work. So he
-fixated the mirror in the ground to reflect some more light onto the
-panel. It worked the power LED lit fully green and the tablet booted
-up. A few seconds later he could see the things happening on the
-screen. All those years had its price. Lines where missing and errors
-where all over the screen, but it still was readable, at least in
-parts. He saw a logo, a name:
-
-    Division 12
-- All Good Things... - 
-
-That didn't tell him much, but the subtitle sounded familiar, but he
-couldn't frame it just yet. His memory was still to faint.
-
-Seconds after the logo the rest of the operating system sprang to
-life. Navigating it wasn't easy, many of the buttons did no longer
-work and the touchscreen also had its problems, making many areas of
-the screen inaccissble. Last not least the flash drive also had given
-up, so most of the documents had more then a few bit flips. Some where
-barely readable, other not at all. However what Belvedere could read
-helped his mind to remember, the details where still blurry, but so
-much was clear. His problem wasn't where we was, but when. 
-
-Belvedere was a scientist involved in a time travel experiment, one
-that obviously had gone wrong quite a bit. He was standing in what he
-thought were the remainings of his divisions outpost, far away from
-civilisation to keep it secret. That of course wasn't helpful at all
-in his situation.
-
-He continued to browse around on the tablet. The building in which he
-had waken up was indeed the place where the time machine had been
-placed, but it obviously was no longer there, even the marks it made
-onto the ground had been washed away over the years. That kind of
-diminished his chances to get back a lot. He was lost and knew it.
-
-Belvedere didn't gave up, the situation was bad, but surviable, at
-least for a while. The maps of the outpost proved useful, with his
-memory still having more holes then swish cheese he could need all the
-help he could get and the maps pointed to a few cellar entrances that
-had been cover up by dirt. So deep in fact that it would have been
-pretty much impossible to find them without it.
-
-The cellars had been socked with water just as the rest, but some of
-the tools he found where still usable. After all not everything was
-build out of degrading materials. With his new tools he was able to
-construct a few primitive traps and weapons. He was surrounded with
-jungle and that jungle contained wildlife, plenty of it, now he only
-needed to catch it.
-
-The lighters that he found where all empty, the gas had evaporated
-long ago, but the fire stones they contained where still usable and
-that was all he needed to make a fire, it would be tricky, but he did
-have some mandatory survivial training in the military, even the
-scientist didn't get spared from that joy and for him that should turn
-out useful.
-
-The comming weeks he spend learning to hunt and to build better
-traps. Training is one thing, but being stuck in the middle of a
-jungle is another. A month and a long beard later he had mastered the
-basic skills. His meals where rare and far appart, but it was enough
-to keep him alive. For how long he couldn't tell, but he still hoped
-that he wouldn't need to find that out. The militar had a leave no man
-behind policy and with a little luck they would need to stay true to
-it.
-
-The days and weeks passed, he stayed alive, but the jungle kept him
-trapped. The sky didn't show any condensation trails so no hope to
-signal planes of his demise. This place really did get selected well,
-far outside of even plane routes. Screw that he thought.
-
-Than one evening, 63 days after he arrived something happened. He saw
-flashes and lighting in the distance. Then nothing, 10 minutes later a
-large explosion shock the jungle. The event was far away, but close
-enough that he should be able to reach it by foot. He collected what
-food he could catch and started his journey. He didn't even know if he
-could pinpoint the spot where his observation occured, but with all
-the flashes and lighting going on he hoped that it would have left a
-large enough mark in the jungle and indeed it did. 
-
-On his sixth day of travel he found it. 'It' however wasn't what he
-expected, not his rescue, not a sign of human life. But just a big
-crater in the ground. All the jungle had been devasted by a 100 meter
-large radius, burned to the ground. What had happened here? He
-couldn't tell and the crater wasn't of any use to him, so he traveled
-back to the outpost.
-
-Three days went by without anything of interest happening on his way
-back to the outpost. On the fourth day however something did
-happen. The flash and lighting occured again, it nearly blinded him so
-close was it, too close for his taste. A second later he realized what
-had happened, he saw it. A Mark III Plasma bomb had appeared right
-before his eyes, he could tell from the writing on its side. It wasn't
-dropped by a plane, it just appeared in a flash of lighting and stand
-there not a hundred meter away from him. He stumbled to it, still
-blended from the flash of its appearence. Has he got closer he
-realized what saw something. Redish letters on the bomb, a clock he
-thought. One ticking down. That second he realized what was happening,
-but he didn't have time to think about it. He had to get moving
-quickly. He run as fast as he could make it through the jungle, in his
-mind counting down the seconds he had seen on the clock.
-
-When his mind said zero he jumped to the ground. Nothing happened. He
-was already on his way up when a blinding flash and the force of a
-shockwave pushed him back down to the ground. Counting down seconds
-had never been his strong point, but managed to get far enough away to
-survive the blast. Once the dust settled he got up and made it back to
-the outpost.
-
-The last month was a cloudy one. Leaving not enough light to power his
-solar panels, so he was locked out of the tablets that might provide
-him valuable information for most of the time. This week however was a
-good one. The sun came through again and the tablet booted
-up. Entering Mark III Plasma he could find a few documents that he has
-missed before. 
-
-{{{
-Remote Time Location Detection
-Ionized Radiation Propagation Through Time
-}}}
-
-That sounded promising and indeed it was. The bombs that have been
-detonating the last few weeks at regular intervals weren't meant as an
-attack, but as a location beacon. Somebody was trying to find him and
-they did that by detonating plasma bombs, which ripple the time stream
-enough to detect it in the past and thus locate the clear location and
-time they detonated. 
-
-He counted twelve bombs going of over a month, from what he could tell
-from the tablet PC that should have been enough to pinpoint a time and
-place. And that his assumption was correct was confirmed on the next
-day, right in the middle of the outpost a box appeared. Was it his
-ticket on the train back to the past?
-
-Opening it up dampened his hopes, it wouldn't be a quick way back. But
-the package contained plenty of things that should make his survival a
-little easier. For one thing a pair of fresh clothes. He hadn't seen
-something like that for months. Clothes asside the package also
-contained plenty of food, energy bars to be precise. Not very tasty,
-but they contained enough nutrition to keep you alive for a good while
-and he had a whole container full of them. The standard military tend
-would keep him farm and dry on the rainy days. And the tools would
-help him get around. A satelite phone was however missing, it would
-have allowed an easy rescue, not back to the past, but back into
-civilisation. They didn't seem to want that, likely military secrecy,
-when you have a time machine you don't want your enemy to know it. It
-is too valueable, even if you are stuck 200 years into the future.
-200 years, that he could tell from the stars, the box contained a good
-amount of astronomical equiment. Along the tools was also a radio
-scanner, allowing him to listen to radio waves, but not broadcasting
-them. However that scanner didn't turn up to be useful, only static
-was what he could hear and that confused him, either the scanner was
-broken or people stopped using radio waves, even out here he should
-have been able to catch something.

+
+* The path to the texture must be relative, not absolute, this can be accomplished with the &quot;Relative Path&quot; option in the file dialog when selecting a texture
+* Images must not be packed, the texture screen (Shift-F10) has a toggle button for that

+== Armatures ==
+
+Armatures and character models should stay seperate.
+
+
+== Lighting ==
+
+Since the models are meant to be used in a game, all the lighting is the job of the game engine, not the .blend file. Model files should thus be free of light sources.

 === Advanced Lighting ===
 
 As mentioned in the HP forum thread, perhaps lighting similar to [[<A HREF="http://www.mechanicalcat.net/tech/ld48/6/bluescrn/diary|FUBAR">http://www.mechanicalcat.net/tech/ld48/6/bluescrn/diary|FUBAR</A>]], a game entered in a 48 hour programming competition (so it can't be that difficult) might add a lot of atmosphere.  Files [[<A HREF="http://www.mechanicalcat.net/tech/ld48/6/bluescrn|available">http://www.mechanicalcat.net/tech/ld48/6/bluescrn|available</A> here]].  I think it needs Windows, but obviously the lighting logic will be portable.

 This page is meant to show what has been decided so far. Please add dialog/script for new plot to the [[Ideas]] page rather than editing this page directly. This page already goes into the actual dialog, if you want a broader overview, go to the [[Plot Events]] page.
