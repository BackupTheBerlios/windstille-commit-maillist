 Seconds after the logo the rest of the operating system sprang to

+work and the touchscreen also had its problems, making many areas of
+the screen inaccissble. Last not least the flash drive also had given
+up, so most of the documents had more then a few bit flips. Some where
+barely readable, other not at all. However what Belvedere could read
+helped his mind to remember, the details where still blurry, but so
+much was clear. His problem wasn't where we was, but when. 
 
+Belvedere was a scientist involved in a time travel experiment, one
+that obviously had gone wrong quite a bit. He was standing in what he
+thought were the remainings of his divisions outpost, far away from
+civilisation to keep it secret. That of course wasn't helpful at all
+in his situation.
 
+He continued to browse around on the tablet. The building in which he
+had waken up was indeed the place where the time machine had been
+placed, but it obviously was no longer there, even the marks it made
+onto the ground had been washed away over the years. That kind of
+diminished his chances to get back a lot. He was lost and knew it.
 
+Belvedere didn't gave up, the situation was bad, but surviable, at
+least for a while. The maps of the outpost proved useful, with his
+memory still having more holes then swish cheese he could need all the
+help he could get and the maps pointed to a few cellar entrances that
+had been cover up by dirt. So deep in fact that it would have been
+pretty much impossible to find them without it.
+
+The cellars had been socked with water just as the rest, but some of
+the tools he found where still usable. After all not everything was
+build out of degrading materials. With his new tools he was able to
+construct a few primitive traps and weapons. He was surrounded with
+jungle and that jungle contained wildlife, plenty of it, now he only
+needed to catch it.
+
+The lighters that he found where all empty, the gas had evaporated
+long ago, but the fire stones they contained where still usable and
+that was all he needed to make a fire, it would be tricky, but he did
+have some mandatory survivial training in the military, even the
+scientist didn't get spared from that joy and for him that should turn
+out useful.
+
+The comming weeks he spend learning to hunt and to build better
+traps. Training is one thing, but being stuck in the middle of a
+jungle is another. A month and a long beard later he had mastered the
+basic skills. His meals where rare and far appart, but it was enough
+to keep him alive. For how long he couldn't tell, but he still hoped
+that he wouldn't need to find that out. The militar had a leave no man
+behind policy and with a little luck they would need to stay true to
+it.
+
+The days and weeks passed, he stayed alive, but the jungle kept him
+trapped. The sky didn't show any condensation trails so no hope to
+signal planes of his demise. This place really did get selected well,
+far outside of even plane routes. Screw that he thought.
+
+Than one evening, 63 days after he arrived something happened. He saw
+flashes and lighting in the distance. Then nothing, 10 minutes later a
+large explosion shock the jungle. The event was far away, but close
+enough that he should be able to reach it by foot. He collected what
+food he could catch and started his journey. He didn't even know if he
+could pinpoint the spot where his observation occured, but with all
+the flashes and lighting going on he hoped that it would have left a
+large enough mark in the jungle and indeed it did. 
+
+On his sixth day of travel he found it. 'It' however wasn't what he
+expected, not his rescue, not a sign of human life. But just a big
+crater in the ground. All the jungle had been devasted by a 100 meter
+large radius, burned to the ground. What had happened here? He
+couldn't tell and the crater wasn't of any use to him, so he traveled
+back to the outpost.
+
+Three days went by without anything of interest happening on his way
+back to the outpost. On the fourth day however something did
+happen. The flash and lighting occured again, it nearly blinded him so
+close was it, too close for his taste. A second later he realized what
+had happened, he saw it. A Mark III Plasma bomb had appeared right
+before his eyes, he could tell from the writing on its side. It wasn't
+dropped by a plane, it just appeared in a flash of lighting and stand
+there not a hundred meter away from him. He stumbled to it, still
+blended from the flash of its appearence. Has he got closer he
+realized what saw something. Redish letters on the bomb, a clock he
+thought. One ticking down. That second he realized what was happening,
+but he didn't have time to think about it. He had to get moving
+quickly. He run as fast as he could make it through the jungle, in his
+mind counting down the seconds he had seen on the clock.
+
+When his mind said zero he jumped to the ground. Nothing happened. He
+was already on his way up when a blinding flash and the force of a
+shockwave pushed him back down to the ground. Counting down seconds
+had never been his strong point, but managed to get far enough away to
+survive the blast. Once the dust settled he got up and made it back to
+the outpost.
+
+The last month was a cloudy one. Leaving not enough light to power his
+solar panels, so he was locked out of the tablets that might provide
+him valuable information for most of the time. This week however was a
+good one. The sun came through again and the tablet booted
+up. Entering Mark III Plasma he could find a few documents that he has
+missed before. 
+
+{{{
+Remote Time Location Detection
+Ionized Radiation Propagation Through Time
+}}}
+
+That sounded promising and indeed it was. The bombs that have been
+detonating the last few weeks at regular intervals weren't meant as an
+attack, but as a location beacon. Somebody was trying to find him and
+they did that by detonating plasma bombs, which ripple the time stream
+enough to detect it in the past and thus locate the clear location and
+time they detonated. 
+
+He counted twelve bombs going of over a month, from what he could tell
+from the tablet PC that should have been enough to pinpoint a time and
+place. And that his assumption was correct was confirmed on the next
+day, right in the middle of the outpost a box appeared. Was it his
+ticket on the train back to the past?
+
+Opening it up dampened his hopes, it wouldn't be a quick way back. But
+the package contained plenty of things that should make his survival a
+little easier. For one thing a pair of fresh clothes. He hadn't seen
+something like that for months. Clothes asside the package also
+contained plenty of food, energy bars to be precise. Not very tasty,
+but they contained enough nutrition to keep you alive for a good while
+and he had a whole container full of them. The standard military tend
+would keep him farm and dry on the rainy days. And the tools would
+help him get around. A satelite phone was however missing, it would
+have allowed an easy rescue, not back to the past, but back into
+civilisation. They didn't seem to want that, likely military secrecy,
+when you have a time machine you don't want your enemy to know it. It
+is too valueable, even if you are stuck 200 years into the future.
+200 years, that he could tell from the stars, the box contained a good
+amount of astronomical equiment. Along the tools was also a radio
+scanner, allowing him to listen to radio waves, but not broadcasting
+them. However that scanner didn't turn up to be useful, only static
+was what he could hear and that confused him, either the scanner was
+broken or people stopped using radio waves, even out here he should
+have been able to catch something.
