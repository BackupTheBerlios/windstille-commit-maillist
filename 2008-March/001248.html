 broken or people stopped using radio waves, even out here he should
 have been able to catch something. 
 
+After playing around with all his new toys he remembered standard
+military practice, he still hasn't read the letter with the new
+orders. But he could blame him, he stranded in nomansland and got a
+box with tinker toys. So play came befor work.
 
+The letter with the order was short, to short for Belvedere's taste,
+somebody in the past obviously hasn't figured out yet that his memory
+still hasn't fully returned yet. It read:
 
+{{{
+After we located you in 2331-02-07 and send you this package, it should
+contain everything you need for a few month of survival.
 
+Time travel had some unexpected consequences here on earth. Need you
+to setup a beam spot to track you and return you and the reverse
+effect.
+
+Count down 20 days till retriever program gets
+initialized. Counting on you.
+}}}
+
+That was all. 'Beam spot'? He couldn't remember what that was, but the
+stuff came with a manual on how to set it up, so he didn't care. 
+
+Sticking the pieces was easy, that just took him a day, but
+calibrating it took him quite a few days and charging up the
+capacitors also took its time. So the 20 day countdown was a needed
+one.
+
+On the 20's day he had the machine setup and fully calibrated back in
+the same spot as he first appeared, he was ready to go. With a push of
+a button he activated the machine and waited for it to come into
+effect. The buzzing sound of the machine told him that it was working
+and the lights where on green. The countdown was down to 00:05:00,
+five minutes to go. He sad down in the middle of it. The buzzing got
+stronger. The machine started to do its job. Flashes of lightning
+started to appear around him. 00:00:30 to go, he could barely read the
+timer, the lightnings got stronger and stronger. 00:00:10 to go. The
+lightnings now started to form a wall around time, the wall turned
+into shape, now was a sphere around him, 00:00:03 to go. He closed his
+eyes, the lightning now was a solid bright white sphere. 00:00:01, he
+couldn't read it, but that is what the clock must have read. Zomg and
+he was gone. A few second later a Mark V Plasma Bomb appeared and
+evaporated the outpost and everything a mile away.
