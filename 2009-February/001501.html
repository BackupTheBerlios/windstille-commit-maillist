+Notes about blender models:
+
+- You can install the exporter by placing it in your $HOME/.blender/scripts
+  directory. Best would be to create a symlink:
+  
+     ln -s contrib/windstille_exporter.py $HOME/.blender/scripts
+     
+- 1 blender unit corresponds to 32pixels in game
+  (if you use the default 800x600 game resolution)
+- When looking at a character turned left from the side, coordinate axes are:
+    z -&gt; up
+    y -&gt; right
+    x -&gt; front
+  (the exporter will convert these to windstille coordinates which are
+   x-&gt;right, y -&gt; down, z -&gt; back)
+- Each blender object should use the same texture on all it's faces.
+   (you can have multiple objects per model of course)
+- You should animate your models with armatures. The exporter will grab all
+  defined actions for the armature and export these. You are only allowed to
+  have 1 armature object in the scene at the moment
+- Empty Objects whose names start with A: are exported as attachement points
+- Take a look at the console output to see warnings and errors from the script
+- You should specify additional attributes for the actions by creating a blender
+  textobject with name &quot;actionconfig&quot;. You can then specify lines like this
+  (this example states that for action MyActionName frames 5 - 40 should be
+   exported every 8th frame should be exported and the animation should be
+   played back with speed 5.7 later. The speed and samplerate part are optional)
+
+  # Sampe actionconfig file
+
+  MyActionName 5 - 40
+  AnotherAction 1 - 30 speed 5.0
+
+  You can append additional options at the line. They are each optional but you
+  have to specify them in this order.
+    speed FLOAT_NUMBER      the default fps speed the animation should be played
+    samplerate INT_NUMBER   only sample every nth frame in blender
+    marker NAME INT_NUMBER  remembers a named marker at a specific frame. These
+                            markers will be used by the program for purposes
+                            like finding out when you can safely change
+                            animations. You can specify multiple markers.
+
+- Windstille has some keys that make debugging animations alot easier:
+    Numpad 2,4,6,8 can be used to move the camera around
+    Numpad +,- zoom in and out.
+    Numpad 1,3 slow down and accelerate the game
+
+    So you can easily zoom in and watch your animation in slow motion with
+    these keys.
+
+(- Only for information you don't have to care about this: UVs in blender are
+    u -&gt; right
+    v -&gt; up
+  UVs in windstille are
+    u -&gt; right
+    v -&gt; down
+  Rotations from windstille rotation compared with blender rotations:
+    ws.x = blend.y
+    ws.y = blend.z
+    ws.z = blend.x )

-= Drawing Operations =
-To bring images on screen you have to execute drawing operations. There are several different types of drawing operations. Each of them depend on a number of parameters.
-
-== Common Parameters ==
-These parameters are used for all drawing operations
-* Position, Rotation, Scale -- These 3 values together are called a modelview transform and are encoded as a 4x4 Matrix
-* Color -- the color is multiplied with each pixel that is drawn
-* blend_sfactor, blend_dfactor -- factors that are used for blending pixels with alpha values on screen (see glBlendFunc for details)
-
-== Text ==
-Writes text on the screen. Parameters:
-* Font -- The font that is used to write the characters (the font has additional attributes like color of the text)
-
-== Surface ==
-Draws a 2d bitmap (called Surface) on screen. Parameters:
-* Surface -- a pointer to a surface (a surface contains the opengl texture handle and uv coordinates)
-
-== Sprite3D ==
-Draws a 3d model on screen. See Sprite3D class for more details. Parameters:
-* Sprite3D -- the 3d sprite that should be drawn
-
-== VertexArray ==
-Executes a drawing command for opengl primiteves. (Typically used for GL_QUAD and GL_TRIANGLE)
-* texture -- texture handle of the opengl texture
-* type -- opengl primitive type
-* vertex list
-* normal list (optional, specified per vertex)
-* color list (optional, specified per vertex)
-
-= State Model and Transform Stack =
-When looking at typical code that does drawing operations, one observes that the
-common parameters are often the same for several drawing operations. It is convenient to 
-not have to specify all parameters again and again for each
-drawing operation. So we created a state machine that maintains a &quot;current&quot; value
-for each of the common parameters.
-
-You can also observe that most of the time the things you want to draw are
-given in a local coordinate system only. Typically you apply a &quot;camera&quot;
-transform to them or have even deeper parent/child relations where the
-coordinate system is relative to the parent. These cases can nicely be handled
-by a stack for the Position, Rotate and Scale attributes. Positions, Rotations
-and Scales are now specified relative to the topmost stack element. You can now simply push
-the transformation from child coordinate system to parent coordinate system on the stack
-and draw all childs in their own coordinate system.
-
-= Foreground/Background and Z-Positions =
-We're presenting a (pseudo) 3d dimensional world on a 2d dimensional screen.
-Handling Foreground and Background requires us to sort the Drawing Operations
-so that stuff in the foreground is drawn after stuff in the background and
-obscures the background.
-
-It's very difficult to enforce a certain drawing order in the code, so we're
-introducing the concept of a z-position. DrawingOperations with higher
-z-positions will be executed after drawing operations with lower z-positions.
-This means that we can't execute the drawing operations imediately anymore, but
-we have to store the information needed to execute them. We call this info a
-Drawing Request. We fill a list with all Drawing Requests and sort them
-according to their z-positions and finally execute them in the correct order.
-
-= Implementation =
-The basic block of the implementation is the DrawingRequest class. It stores all
-information needed to execute a drawing operation. You can create custom subclasses from this class and override
-the draw() function to execute your custom drawing operations. You can expect
-that all common parameters that are maintained by the DrawingContext are already
-setup when the draw() function is called.
-
-The DrawingContext class is responsible for the state management and maintains
-the modelview transform stack.
-
-= Optimisations =
-To correctly implement the drawing operations we have to create snaphots of the
-current drawing state and append it to all DrawingRequests. You can observe that
-for most drawing operations in a typical scene these snapshots contain identical
-values except for the position.
-
-So we factor out the modelview and color+blendfunctions used in DrawingRequests
-to point to a shared block that is used by multiple Drawing Requests. This not
-only reduces memory consumption but also allows for more efficient restoring of
-the drawing state in opengl. As we can now compare the pointers of the
-ModelView and color+blenfunc objects and only reset these values if the
-pointers are different.

-There are plenty of ways to construct Blender models (*.blend) in a way that they don't work properly on other machines, this text shall give a little guideline on things to keep in mind.
-
-== Textures ==
-
-* The path to the texture must be relative, not absolute, this can be accomplished with the &quot;Relative Path&quot; option in the file dialog when selecting a texture

-Since the models are meant to be used in a game, all the lighting is the job of the game engine, not the .blend file. Model files should thus be free of light sources.

-Relativly new in the mercenary business, started to hire at Northern Star when she turned 18, wanted to get away from home as quickly as possible, wanted to see the stars, visit other worlds and the like. Worked as miner for some years now, visited a bunch of colonies, however quickly become sick of the mining business. She is now out of the mining business and tries to start a new living here on this colonie.

Has lots of connections to different people around on this colonie. For most part see prefers to work alone. Tough women overall.

-A valuable informant in this city. He knows most people around and he knows where the good jobs are to find. If something is happening his bar is the place where people exchange information. He might not be the most friendly looking guy, but once you know him for a while one shouldn't have to much throuble to get along with him. He tries his best to keep his bar a save place.

-One of the many contract workers which work for the Northern Star Mining cooroperation. The NSM often hires people and send them out to the different colonies to dig for resources. Their income is connected to the amount of resources which they collect, so if stuff doesn't work that right, they might quickly lose interesting, since only resources bring them income. Most of the time they are send out to a colonie for a few weeks or month, then send to another one, once the given resource region is harvested. Overall they can be hard workers, but only if the resources can motivate them.

-Realistically, milestone 1 is only going to be able to have a very limited number of locations. This is an attempt to keep track of what locations we actually intend to create  - which requires art, level design, coding the required game objects, populating the location with characters and bad guys, and including the location in the plot.
-
-== VR Training ==
-
-* Used for the opening tutorial for the game.
-
-* provides a number of sub rooms to allow the player to train all kinds of stuff
-
-== City ==
-
-* Jane's apartment
-
-This is where the game opens. Perhaps it could be reused for other things, too?
-
-* Street / roof tops
-
-Maybe we will have a sector that just represents walking about the city? I don't know.
-
-* Bar
-
-Used for meeting some of the characters, perhaps you may go here for jobs, or whatever.
-
-* Train station
-
-Maybe this isn't needed, but we have a train model and train stations are a good location for meeting characters and travelling, and they also add to the feel that you are in a living city.
-
-* Shuttle port
-
-Where you get on shuttles to take you away from the city
-
-== Forest ==
-
-This is where the Milestone 1 powersuit mission takes place.
-
-* Above ground
-
-Will contain trees, and maybe some swamp or something too. The idea seems to be that on the forest surface your enemies are the local wildlife, not humans or aliens or whatever. The final boss is a huge spider (though they could be put below ground, see below)
-
-* Underground
-
-Both man made mines and natural labyrinth. Quite possibly it will contain some robots of various sorts for bad guys, perhaps also spiders.
