 C++ functions are exposed to scripts via the interface in the {{{scripting/}}} sub directory&quot;. Miniswig, found in the &quot;tools/miniswig&quot; subdirectory, is a tool that creates wrapper functions to allow the interface functions to be called from squirrel. If you have bison and flex installed then miniswig will be built automatically, and any changes you make to the scripting interface will automatically be added to the wrapper functions when you execute jam.
