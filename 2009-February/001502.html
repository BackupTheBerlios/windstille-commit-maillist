-The game has basically 3 different control modes, one is with the powersuit, one is for player without the powersuit and a seperate mode is there for the player with his weapon equiped without the powersuit.
-
-== Moving around without a gun / Adventure Mode
-
-Moving around without the gun puts you basically into an adventure-mode, ie. a mode where you don't spend most of your time fighting, but talking to people, exploring city, factories and stuff.
-
-== Gunfights without the powersuit
-
-When you meet somebody in the adventure mode that you need to fight, you have the ability to draw your gun.  This mode should focus on allowing the player to perform a close-distance gun fight, walking/jumping in this mode is limited to what makes sense with a drawn gun.
-
-== Fighting with the powersuit
-
-When you have the powersuit equiped the gameplay changes quite a bit in that it gives you much more strength, higher jumps, power for your weapons and simply different weapons. However the powersuit is not allowed in some areas and won't be of much use in other, ie. when you want to sneak into enemy territory. The powersuit will also not be available at its full strength from the beginning of the game.

-Will we need different weapon stages like Turrican or static ones? (Weaponstage &lt;-&gt; Hero's energie!?)

-The game will have a jetpack, I am currently not sure if we have it as a item which you can use all the time or just in some special events/levels.

-Should the hero be able to shoot in different directions or should be stick to a MegaMan like shooting?

-The game will not be sperated into normal levels, instead it will consist of 'sections', where one can more or less move freely around. Translating between section will be done via special events (like the water-thing in another world) or via doors (where one has to find the keys before passing them). Moving forward and backward should basically possible, but there might be points-of-no-return. Some kind of guidance system should always show you where to go, so that one doesn't lost himself in a level.
-
-== Different types of assault suits

-
-=== Ice
-
-might protect against ice water and give better grip on ice
-
-=== Fire/Lava

-protect better against lava and hot regions
-
-=== Level File Format
-
-The level file format will be at its basic level tile based, support for multiple overlapping tiles would be nice, the tile size will be 128x128. In addition the map might support brushes, meaning you can insert (animated) surface objects at arbitrary positions, not sure how this will influence the collision map.

-== 2025 - Landing on the Moon, again
-
-In preparation for the mission to Mars mankind planed a research mission to moon with the goal to setup a small colony 
-
-== 2032 - Landing on Mars
-
-Fifthy years late, but mankind had finally made it to Mars. The two year trip brought many new insights into long time travel and also ignited the interest in space colonisation again.
-
-== 2040 - Moon Colony
-
-The Moon colony, once started as a testbed for the Mars mission, was now nearing its 15 anniversary. It no longer was limited to the two base modules with which it ones started, it now had grown into a small village and got frequent visits not only from the national space agencies but also from private enterprises. Space tourism has moved to whole new levels with the Moon Colony
-
-== 2050 - Space Telescope
-
-With the help of the Moon Colony a new space telescope was assembled, one good enough to discover planets and collect information about them.
-
-== 2060 - Project Longshot
-
-Project Longshot once started as an idea in the late 1970's now became reality. The telescopes had discovered a planet system around Alpha Centauri B and it was now Longshot job to profide some close up views, but as always with space travel, this wasn't going to be a short journey.
-
-== 2110 - Arrival
-
-Longshot entered the planet system of Alpha Centauri B, it was the first time a man-made object had done so.  As programmed Longshot launched a couple of small daughter satellites to do the closer inspection, while Longshot itself, to heavy to slow down, would continue through the system and into the void of space.
-
-On their journey through the system the satelites produced some very detailed images of the planets and also discovered dozens of moons formerly unknown moons and smaller planets.
-
-One planet, called Central, seemed perfect for collonisation, it had already a very earthlike athmosphere and plenty of water, in fact it consists to nine tenth out of water, which meant it had only little land to offer, but that should be more then enough to get a colonie started. Later collonisation could then happen via city-ships and similar land-creating endevours. The land that was there should be enough for a few decades to come.
-
-The other was Hoti, it had an athmosphere, not breathable, but not toxic either, a simple oxygen masks should be enough to protect the population outside and inside the city there could be a decent athmosphere. 
-
-The last canditat was named Nugani, it was a moon close to the gas giant Ensani. 
-
-== 2220 - Collonisation
-
-The Longshot drones had collected information about the new system for many decades and it became clear that the system provided habitatable planets. Plans for collonisation where put into place. 
-
-Along with those ships carriing the people, automatic ships where send that should handle the terraforming.
-
-== 2263 - Collonisation - Phase 1
-
-The trip to Alpha Centauri took fourthy years. A handful of landing capsules where lost on entry, but that is probably to be expected on such a riski trip. 
-
-As planed the terraforming started. While the atmosphere wasn't toxic by itself, it lacked enough oxigen to sustain human settlements, so the first few decades where spend in environment suits or with oxigen masks. 
-
-== 2312 - Terraforming
-
-The robotic probes arrive and terraforming begins.
-
-== 2380 - Collonisation - Phase 2
-
-With the terraforming making progress it become clear that it wouldn't take much longer till the atmosphere of Zeta-12 become breathable. So the humans got ready to move to Alpha Centauri B.
-
-A dozens ships where build, each with the ability to carry 16 entry capsules, each carring around 40 people. 640 people per ship 25 ships in total.
-
-== 2382 - Collonisation - Corruption
-
-Unknown by the earth government, the company Red Star, had build a handful of collonisation ships themselves.

+== 2025 - Landing on the Moon, again
+
+In preparation for the mission to Mars mankind planed a research mission to moon with the goal to setup a small colony 
+
+== 2032 - Landing on Mars
+
+Fifthy years late, but mankind had finally made it to Mars. The two year trip brought many new insights into long time travel and also ignited the interest in space colonisation again.
+
+== 2040 - Moon Colony
+
+The Moon colony, once started as a testbed for the Mars mission, was now nearing its 15 anniversary. It no longer was limited to the two base modules with which it ones started, it now had grown into a small village and got frequent visits not only from the national space agencies but also from private enterprises. Space tourism has moved to whole new levels with the Moon Colony
+
+== 2050 - Space Telescope
+
+With the help of the Moon Colony a new space telescope was assembled, one good enough to discover planets and collect information about them.
+
+== 2060 - Project Longshot
+
+Project Longshot once started as an idea in the late 1970's now became reality. The telescopes had discovered a planet system around Alpha Centauri B and it was now Longshot job to profide some close up views, but as always with space travel, this wasn't going to be a short journey.
+
+== 2110 - Arrival
+
+Longshot entered the planet system of Alpha Centauri B, it was the first time a man-made object had done so.  As programmed Longshot launched a couple of small daughter satellites to do the closer inspection, while Longshot itself, to heavy to slow down, would continue through the system and into the void of space.
+
+On their journey through the system the satelites produced some very detailed images of the planets and also discovered dozens of moons formerly unknown moons and smaller planets.
+
+One planet, called Central, seemed perfect for collonisation, it had already a very earthlike athmosphere and plenty of water, in fact it consists to nine tenth out of water, which meant it had only little land to offer, but that should be more then enough to get a colonie started. Later collonisation could then happen via city-ships and similar land-creating endevours. The land that was there should be enough for a few decades to come.
+
+The other was Hoti, it had an athmosphere, not breathable, but not toxic either, a simple oxygen masks should be enough to protect the population outside and inside the city there could be a decent athmosphere. 
+
+The last canditat was named Nugani, it was a moon close to the gas giant Ensani. 
+
+== 2220 - Collonisation
+
+The Longshot drones had collected information about the new system for many decades and it became clear that the system provided habitatable planets. Plans for collonisation where put into place. 
+
+Along with those ships carriing the people, automatic ships where send that should handle the terraforming.
+
+== 2263 - Collonisation - Phase 1
+
+The trip to Alpha Centauri took fourthy years. A handful of landing capsules where lost on entry, but that is probably to be expected on such a riski trip. 
+
+As planed the terraforming started. While the atmosphere wasn't toxic by itself, it lacked enough oxigen to sustain human settlements, so the first few decades where spend in environment suits or with oxigen masks. 
+
+== 2312 - Terraforming
+
+The robotic probes arrive and terraforming begins.
+
+== 2380 - Collonisation - Phase 2
+
+With the terraforming making progress it become clear that it wouldn't take much longer till the atmosphere of Zeta-12 become breathable. So the humans got ready to move to Alpha Centauri B.
+
+A dozens ships where build, each with the ability to carry 16 entry capsules, each carring around 40 people. 640 people per ship 25 ships in total.
+
+== 2382 - Collonisation - Corruption
+
+Unknown by the earth government, the company Red Star, had build a handful of collonisation ships themselves. While NStars ships flow in a large group, so that they could give each other support on the long journey, the ships of Red Star where build for speed. They where build to overtake the NStar fleed and arrive at Alpha Centauri B first. The idea was simple, new land was freely available and whoever got there first was the one who could land claim to it. And Red Star was prepared to do exactly that. Not only where their ships faster, they also carried plenty of guns to protect their land. NStars fleed wasn't equiped or prepared for a war, they where launched with the expection to be the first.

-This is a list of basic features we should either get from additional libraries or write small classes ourself.
-
-= Basics =
-* Setting up Fullscreen/Windowed OpenGL Context, the mode should be switchable at runtime
-* Gathering Input from Keyboard/Joystick/Mouse
-* Allow input to be configurable
-* Demo recording/playback of input
-* Some structured file format parser/writer for config, map, tile- and sprite-definition files
-* Optionally support for a binary format, since loading large tilemaps from a structured text file is slow
-* Some way to store/retrieve translated strings (tinygettext)
-
-= Graphics =
-* Loading images (png, jpeg would be a nice addition but is not mandatory) and creating opengl textures from them
-* A system that gathers all drawing commands, sorts them and maybe optimizes them for opengl
-* The drawing system should be statefull to allow translation and maybe scaling and rotating of following drawing commands. It should be possible to maintain a stack of such transformations.
-
-== Fonts ==
-* We need Fonts to display Text on screen
-* Fonts might be based on TTF for easier scaling/unicode support etc.
-* it should be possible to apply some effects to fonts, black-border, color gradients, glow, etc.
-* Fonts sholud be antialised
-
-== Sprites ==
-* Several Animations that can be switched. Animations are defined from a series of images. Speed of the animation or even single frames should be freely adjustable.
-* It should be possible to freely define the origin point of a sprite
-* Animation images can be extracted from bigger images (texture coordinate animation)
-* Support for reversing animations and mirroring/flipping the images will reduce the number of images needed.
-* We might have to extend sprites to support the 3 layer displaying of windstille
-* Sprites should be defined in datafiles, so that properties like framerate and such are easily changable
-* Sprites can come in the form of 2D (generated from pngs) and 3D sprites (generated from blender models)
-
-= Sound =
-* A way to send sound to the soundcard.
-* Load wav and ogg files
-* Stream ogg files for background music
-* Mix several sound sources together
-* Positional audio (we could also build a fake solution with adjuts panning/volume)
-* Effects applied to sound streams (echo, reverb, etc)

-There are plenty of ways to construct Blender models (*.blend) in a way that they don't work properly on other machines, this text shall give a little guideline on things to keep in mind.
-
-== Textures ==
-
-* The path to the texture must be relative, not absolute, this can be accomplished with the &quot;Relative Path&quot; option in the file dialog when selecting a texture
-* Images must not be packed, the texture screen (Shift-F10) has a toggle button for that

-Armatures and character models should stay seperate.

-Since the models are meant to be used in a game, all the lighting is the job of the game engine, not the .blend file. Model files should thus be free of light sources.

Their income is connected to the amount of resources which they collect, so if stuff doesn't work that right, they might quickly lose interesting, since only resources bring them income. Most of the time they are send out to a colonie for a few weeks or month, then send to another one, once the given resource region is harvested. Overall they can be hard workers, but only if the resources can motivate them.

+++ trunk/media/wiki/Collision Detection.wiki	2009-02-16 21:22:36 UTC (rev 2504)
@@ -1,63 +0,0 @@
-Basic features that need to be handled by the physic/collision engine: 
-
-* properly detection of the side at which two boxes collide so that the game can react as expected (player pushes a box, player jumps on a moving platform from below, player jumps on an enemy vs gets hit by an enemy, etc.)
-* allow to stack crates, boxes and stuff
-* allow to shoot in a stack of boxes and let the stack collapse
-* conveyor belts
-* slopes in the tilemap (not that important)
-
-Stuff that is not needed:
-
-* rotating boxes, while probally pretty, they cause more trouble then good, both on the programming side as well as on the gameplay side (what happens when you jump on a box which has a 45 degree angel?)
-
-== Collision Domains ==
-
-The collision detection should seperate different kind of objects into different collision domains, so that objects that are not in the same domain aren't checked at all against each other. Domains could be:
-
-* CollidesWithPlayer
-* CollidesWithEnemy
-* CollidesWithProjectile
-* ...
-
-Domains could be implemented as a simple 'unsigned int' for the CollisionObject
-
-== Collision Callback ==
-
-Once a collision occured the engine should give the object usefull feedback for resolving the collision, the engine should *not* resolve collisions on its own. The engine should instead move the object as close to the other object as possible and then call the callback:
-
- CollisionObject::collision(CollisionEvent&amp; collision);
-
- struct CollisionEvent
- {
-  // is NONE actually needed?
-  enum State { NONE, STUCK, COLLISION, CONTACTBREAK } state;
- 
-  // should be enough no need for a vector IMHO
-  enum Side  { TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT };
- 
-  // the object which with 'this' collided
-  CollisionObject* object;
- 
-  // the amount of time that has not yet been used up
-  float rest_delta;
- };
-
-Collision resolution could then either mean to change the direction, to simply halt or to attach oneself to the other object (ie. that is how moving platforms should find the player).
-
-== Movement ==
-
-All movement from objects that collide *must* happen via the collision engine, this should happen via a simple CollisionObject::set_velocity(x, y) or CollisionObject::set_positio(x, y) call, no actually forces or other physics should come into play, since most objects simply won't react physical correct.
-
-== Implementation ==
-
-To detect the time and point of collision the standard sweepcheck should be used, this check needs to be performed for all possible object combination, after that the detected collisions should be sorted after the their time and then resolved one after another. Since the collision response might actually lead to new collisions, the check needs to be redone again for the involved objects (maybe for all objects?!). This is done up to the point where all time for all objects is used up.
-
-CollisionObject should *not* be a parent of entity. This has the simple reason that a entity might need multiple CollisionObject. Imagine a large robot with multiple legs, each of the feet is represented by a CollisionObject, the whole robot however should be handled as a single entity, which would be impossible if Entity derives from CollisionObject (unless of course you add a heapload of useless grouping features to the collision engine).
-
-== Attachments/Contacts ==
-
-There should be a way to link objects together, this linking might either be primitive, ie. simple parenting without taking care if objects connect at all, or more complex, ie. a box that is standing ontop of another box. The collision engine should check when such a contact is no longer in place and give an appropriate event. There should also be a way to detect the angle of the contact point so that you can move objects at other speed when they walk up/down a slope.
-
-== Links ==
-
-[[<A HREF="http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/tutorials.html">http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/tutorials.html</A>]] has plenty of very good docu about collision detection between different object types.

-* a 'select' button, used to open the PDA/Inventory
-* a aim button, used to switch between normal mode and shooting
-* a pause button

-* 'wasd' for primary, secondary, tertiary and 'select'
-* 'shift' for aim
-* 'p' for pause
-* 'cursorkeys' for steering
-* 'enter' + 'escape' for confirm/cancel

-Controls in general should be context sensitive meaning there don't necessarily is a hard mapping between a button and what you do, this could for example mean that the jump executed when you are standing infront of a ledge is a different one than when standing on normal ground or on the edge of a cliff or that when you walk against a wall you halt or when walking against a box you automatically start to push the box.

-* Sketches and desriptions of the characters

-* Create a sketch of the menus and describe their functions
-* Weapon sketches with description and how they are controlled
-* Try to split the work to people actively helping on the project. So that everyone has his own part he works on. This avoids everyone focusing on everything which often leads to bugs because you don't understand other peoples code/intentions or because some areas are left unattended.

-Engine Design:
-* Outline the features needed for the engine
-* Decide about technology
-* Fix file formats (map, tiles, sprites/animations, scripts)
-* How should collision detection and response be handled. Basically think about game mechanics.
-* Create a rough class hirarchy
-* Identify where scripts should be used and design a scripting API
-* What interactions are needed between GameObjects, how to handle them
-* How do we handle savegames, do we need to have serialisation support across the project or will we do simpler solutions?

-It is logical if each character you speak to has their own, singular script file to represent converations with that character. When you start a conversation with that character in game, their corresponding dialog script file will be loaded and run. When the conversation ends, the script will be pushed off the stack (or whatever the correct terminology is). If dialogs become non blocking, then dialog manager will have to pause running of the dialog script until you make a choice whilst the rest of the game keeps running, but they can be left blocking for now, probably forever.
-
-Each dialog function below should be thought of like a page in a &quot;Choose your own story&quot; book, or like a foward-linked list - it has no state with regards to a stack, but is instead a self contained unit, which includes forward links to other dialogs depending what option you choose. This means that dialog can jump across to a shared branch, which would not be possible if you just used a lot of nested switch statements (if you look at the dialog in a point and click adventure or an RPG, you will see there is a lot of branch-hopping).

-Some thoughts on fighting in Windstille.
-
-== Human Mode ==
-
-Another World had a very interesting way to fight. You had a gun that you could charge, in three stages:
-
-# fire a normal shoot
-# build a shield infront of you
-# fire a huge blast that will crack a shild or destroy a wall
-
-Enemies only used shields and normal shoots and shields had a limited amount of time how long they hold, multiple shields were possible. A single shoot that hit would kill an enemy or you. So you had to constantly keep your shield up while at the same time trying to charge up a powershoot to destroy the enemies shield.
-
-Flashback is somewhat similar, but here you can survive a few hits and the shield isn't a weapon firing mode, but a seperate item. Shield only opens up for a second and closes again, so it all depends on your timing to open the shield shortly before the enemy fires a shoot. Enemies don't use any shields if I remember correctly.
-
-AstroyBoy uses a rather special weapon based fight system, each punch to an enemy fills up your powermeter, once its full you can fire a special attack, so fighting focuses on filling up the meter and starting special attacks so that they hit the most enemies.
-
-Dancing Stage like where you have to press a given number of buttons to be successfull
-
-Viewtifull Joe like where a direction to dodge is shown shortly before the enemies action, so you can dodge.

-This is required by the Flexlay level editor but not by Windstille itself. ClanLib itself also needs some additional libraries and programs to compile like pkg-config, libjpeg, libpng, libvorbis and some other things, however all those should come with your distro, so it shouldn't be to much trouble to install them. Check the [[<A HREF="http://www.clanlib.org/subversion.html|Official">http://www.clanlib.org/subversion.html|Official</A> ClanLib Webpage]] for details.

-The current graphics engine works by using three layers, to each of the layers you can draw independly. They are only later down the pipeline flushed down to the screen. The multiple layers are necessary for once to properly sort the graphics and secondly they are needed to create certain effects. The layer are:
-
-== Color Layer ==
-
-This is a normal layer, it contains just good old graphics as you would expect and is drawn as if you would draw directly to the screen.
-
-== Light Layer ==
-
-This layer specifies which areas of the screen are visible and which aren't. At start everything is invisible (black), to make stuff visible one uses white. One can also use other colors, red, green, etc. The light layer is later multiplied with the color layer, thus everything that is black (0) gets blended out and everything else gets lit by the color found in the light layer. Drawing to this layer should almost always happen via additive blending.
-
-== Highlight Layer ==
-
-The highlight layer is drawn ontop of the light layer, it is meant for lense-flares, glows and other effects that should be 100% visible all of the time and not covered by the light-layers shadow. It is the same as the color layer, only that the light layer doesn't get multiplied with it. Drawing should again be happening mostly additive, since thats gets closest to how real light acts.
-
-= 3D Sprites =
-
-The idea behind 3D sprites is to avoid the annoying and disk-space consuming procedure of converting all animations into 2D images. This should also allow to much easier apply different skins to the models and change cloth or the like. Bone animation and ragdoll physics would be nice, but for the first few releases (or probally ever) simple keyframe animation would be enough. Bone deform animation can be exported by something like this (only code to get the actual mesh data, no file writing there):

The good news is that they are rather easy to implement, the bad news is that one needs some framework to implement them properly, ie. first of one needs to get them through ClanLib and secondly for most effects one needs a copy of the current framebuffer, which however is rather expensive to read, so its hard to get. They are also rather GPU heavy, so when not handled with care they won't work on low-end graphic cards (GeforceFX5200, ATI9200) and they don't work at all on even older cards, so they would need to be optional.

-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; yep, think so
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; so what is up for discussion?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; grumbel: are you logging
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: good question :)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: unless my xchat crashes I will have a log
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; Opera can't log, which is dumb, maybe I should get a proper IRC client some time
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; line72, PauloMorfeo, straver: interesting in helping developing?
-
-&lt;line72&gt; yes
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; line72: which area? graphics, prog, story, etc?
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; is WolfganB just logging?
-
-&lt;line72&gt; mainly programming
-
-&lt;line72&gt; some graphics (2d and 3d)
-
-&lt;straver&gt; yes, but I ca't ufor two weeks
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: not sure
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; ?
-
-&lt;line72&gt; Its me and several others from our gamedev club are going to help out
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; WolfgangB: hi, wanna help too?
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; ther should be a log function somewhere
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; let
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; wolfgang, I just meant, are you really here or had you just left an IRC client connected to log the conversation whilst you went out. Obviousuly not.
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; So at least to start with we have quite a few people then.
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; grumbel, yes, i can do some programming. 
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; <A HREF="http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Jobs">http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Jobs</A> has some tasks available
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; okay, i learnd something about blender in lincity 
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; but it will look like the placeholder images :)
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; I'll work on animations and voices...
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; anybody interesting in writing a opengl based ttf font system?
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; are the clanlib fonts not good enough?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; no system fonts in linux
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: a) we might get rid of clanlib b) bitmap fonts are rather throuble some with multiple encodings
-
-&lt;straver&gt; I'll most likely do some programming but I'll wait and see what tasks are left
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; the bitmap fonts are fine as long as one doesn't need a different fontsize or something different than latin1
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; past has however shown that sooner or later people always want to translate to non-latin1 languages
-
-&lt;line72&gt; nehe has a tutorial on using freetype2 with opengl
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; yeah, thought I'd seen that before
-
---- grumbel has changed the topic to: Meeting at 18:00GMT - now
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; the ttf support is not really urgend, just some thing that we might need sooner or later, so if anybody wanna pick that task..
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; If someone wants to add support for non-European languages then fair enough, but given the amount of other work to do I don't think it's a priority
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; if there is voice-acting, localisation will be difficult alyway.
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: it really depends if you switch away from clanlib, if we do, then it might be better to start with ttf renderer then doing a bitmap renderer
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; WolfgangB: simply switch voice acting off
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; ok, so let's talk about clanlib: use or don't use...
-
-&lt;line72&gt; what's the option if we don't use it
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; oh, so voice is just reading on screen texts, no replacement for them?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; line72: write stuff ourself &amp; recycle supertux code
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; WolfgangB: yes
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; and recycle ClanLib code too, possibly?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: yep, that too
-
-&lt;line72&gt; so, is this going to be 2d or 3d ?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; mix
-
-&lt;line72&gt; meaning we render everything in 3d, or we create 3d models, animated them, and generate 2d sprites from them ?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; line72: tilemaps will be 2d, some sprites will be 2d and we will have 3d sprites, ie. simple meshes
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; 3d sprites will be used when it makes sense for memory
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; and when the graphic requires it
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; one thing are characters which will most likly be all 3d
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; other thing are stuff like cars or spaceships that might need to rotate to land/start
-
-&lt;straver&gt; but that's easy in 2d withopengl anyway
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; yes, but then you get large textures
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; so what would be the advantage of leaving clanlib, other than reducing dependencies?
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; have a system you can understand in shorter time?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; straver: the other two axes which are not z
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; straver: if you do that in 3d than you get *huge* texture
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; straver: 640x480 * 24 frames per second like
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; clanlib is no harder to understand than ano other library
-
-&lt;line72&gt; my only issue with clanlib is we need the cvs version
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; line72: that IMHO a non-issue
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; the only change to clanlib cvs in the past week was a win32 makefile fix, by me. It doesn't change much, the issue is just that they haven't made a new release for ages.
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; the important parts go more into the direction of how hard is it to add shader support to clanlib
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; or how much of clanlib do we really need
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: nothing clanlib fix is to change the near/far clipping planes from -1/1 to something larger, however not yet commited
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; anyway, thats more the kind of problems I expect if we stay with clanlib
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; Well, anyway, if we drop clanlib because it's easier for people writing graphics code then I won't complain, but I don't think we should rewrite a whole load of code just to reduce dependencies. There could be a new ClanLib release to coincide with Windstille, or otherwise just before release ClanLib could be copied into its own directory in Windstille.
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: yep
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; clanlib release is just waiting for someone to do it...
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; so the decision on clanlib should be made by whoever it is who is coding graphics stuff?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: I would say we simply continue as we are and see if there is any clanlib left after a while
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; ok
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; ie. adding opengl based ttf font handling or switching tilemap to raw gl is all rather independed of clanlib
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; what other potentially controversial issues are there to discuss before we can discuss division of tasks?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; question to all: have you actually played flashback or looked at least at the video in the &quot;Similar Games&quot; section in the wiki?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; just so that everybody has a basic idea with what we start
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; I have played it briefly, so I know how it works.
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; no, i heard about the whole thing just yesterday
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; I couldn't get the avi to play
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; playing &quot;Another World&quot;/&quot;Out of this World&quot; and/or &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; might help as well
-
-&lt;line72&gt; watching it now
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; i compiled windstille and looked at it, thats about it

-&lt;quickflash&gt; prince of persia I recall

-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; to make the avi play open it up i na hex editor and change the two occurences of &quot;FCMP&quot; or whatever it is to &quot;XVID&quot;
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; rotoscoped animation
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: flashback is basically the same, except you have a gun and you walk around in a city

-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: at least in some levels
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; I played the original prince of persia a bit, too
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; if somebody could explain me how to encode videos in linux that actually work that would be helpfull...
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; stuff that mplayer produces is seldomly usable 
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; encode them in a less advanced format - MPEG4 is all well and good but support varies
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; even after editing the second video it still crashes vlc
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; mplayer says &quot;Video: no video&quot; to the first one.
-
-&lt;egore&gt; grumbel: kmenc15 or kino are quite helpfull
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; its working with xine. strange
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; it's because it uses the codec fourcc &quot;FCMP&quot; or something which is very new and most players don't yet realise that it is the same as MPEG4
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; but anyway, back to windstille
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; here a little screenshot: <A HREF="http://www.classicgaming.com/rotw/flash2.gif">http://www.classicgaming.com/rotw/flash2.gif</A>
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; anyway, point is windstille will have at least two basic modes
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; one will be that girl in normal cloth with realistic movement and abiliies
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; apparently I meant fmp4, not fcmp
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; the other will be girl in powersuit and thus more strength, faster, higher jumps, etc.
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; without the powersuit will be more or less an adventure mode, one where you walk around, buy stuff, talk to people 
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; maybe infiltrate some factory, sneak around and such
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; powersuit will be used outside of the city, on alien plants or in space
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; thats basically what we are aiming at
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; don't have much idea yet how the powersuit should play
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; something metroid-ish maybe, but then I don't like that jumps at all
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; metroidish
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; so its supertux with different graphics?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; WolfgangB: nothing like supertux
-
-&lt;straver&gt; I got the impression the game was supposed to be nonlinear
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; more like gta as sidescroller
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; So I take it the player will have a gun, but the gun will be flashback like (very slow rate of fire, time consuming to aim) than like metroid (hold down fire button)?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: in human mode definitivly
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; and in power suit mode too?
-
-&lt;straver&gt; will the player be able to buy new weapons and upgrade the powersuit and so?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; in powersuit mode I am not sure, but even there I would prefer something that is a lot less fast then metroid
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; something that gives you a realistic feel for the powersuit and not the ability to jump around like a flubber
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; if even in powersuit mode it will be quite slow paced, might it not be simpler if powersuit mode was a bit less different to normal mode than you are proposing? I.e., same control system, same basic gameplay style, just you cna jump higher and take more damage
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; straver: most likly
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; straver: however I am not so sure how much freedom is usefull there
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: not sure, but powersuit should really feel different and more then just higher jumps
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; So what is the difference?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; well, I want powersuit mode to be slower then metroid, but thats still a lot faster then flashback
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; so it might mean to take something like metroid controls and replace the spin-jump with something more realistic
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; so, ok, in power suit mode will you shoot bad guys by a) aiming a firing once or b) jumping on to a platform and holding down the fire button?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; depends on the weapon I would say
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; ie. you could use a handgun or a bazooker style thing
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; depending on what the current mission offers
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; ok
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; powersuit mode might provide a auto-lock-on or so on enemies
-
-&lt;straver&gt; and what control method are we going to use. I really like the abuse mouse/keyboard control.
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; definitvly not abuse like
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; I hate them
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; currently I am aiming for cursorkeys + wasd
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; so left/right -&gt; walk
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; one button to run
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; one to use/talk
-
-&lt;straver&gt; what's so bad with mouse aim? gives you more precision
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; one to draw the gun
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; straver: I don't like precision, it simply feels rather unnatural
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; gamepad support?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; beside from that you don't need precision
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; (19:11:23) grumbel: Sorry, i was playing TA::Spring :P I don't expect to have enough time to do helping around this GOTM, unfortunatly... But i may do some things like voices if/when needed! (or something that doesn't require much time nor much learning to do)
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; So will we start off working on both game modes at once, or concentrate on just one to start with?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; PauloMorfeo: ok
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: starting with human mode I would say
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; since thats rather clear how it should look like
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; so first step would be to get the virtual environment ready, add doors, scripting, dialog
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; then start creating the city 
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; OK
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; and somewhere inbetween there toy around with powersuit tests
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; MazteB said he would do scripting?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg: yep
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; grumbel, what language was planed for scripting?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; its already in supertux and looks quite nice
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; WolfgangB: squirrel
-
-&lt;jamesg&gt; it seems like we need scripting quite soon because lots of other stuff relies on it - e.g. I imagine doors will be implemented as scriptable objects? Is he going to do it soon?
-
-&lt;egore&gt; WolfgangB: supertux uses it's own, afaik
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; he is currently playing around with openal
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; but scripting would be the next step
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; doors themself don't need scripting, a 'sector'  property would already be enough
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; egore: its squirrel in supertux
-
-&lt;egore&gt; grumbel: ah, ok
-
-&lt;egore&gt; grumbel: now that you mention it, I remember it :D
-
-&lt;line72&gt; should we start assigning tasks ?
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; I supose it would be more like taking task onto self rather than assigning...
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; so whats the technical difference between windstille and supertux? Sounds more or less the same to me.
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; WolfgangB: well, technically its of course similar, gameplay wise however not
-
-&lt;egore&gt; and supertux is more in direction of SDL, while windstille goes towards clanlib
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; graphically its a bit different since windstille supports lightmapping and 3d sprites
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Grumbel: Is it suposed to scrool like SuperTux or to change screens like the old one... Forget it, i remember, it scrools!
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; would it be easier to change the gameplay in supertux than create something new?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; PauloMorfeo: its supposed to scroll around, not screen switches
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; WolfgangB: no
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Yes, i remember from playing that little demo!

-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; thats how windstille looks right now
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; on the right is a particle based fire
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; on the left a 3d sprite
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; in the middle a old 2d sprite
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; surrounded by light
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; the glow of the vr-tiles is a seperate highlight-layer
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; the different layers can be switched on and off via 1,2,3,4
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; about the 'story'/beginning of the game: game should start in a virtual environment where the player learns the basic movement
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; after that he leaves the VR, walk a bit around in his apartment, gets phonecall and is called over to a bar in the city
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; where he then gets the first mission assigned 
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; <A HREF="http://esoteric.clanlib.org/~khirsch/windstille/Run.avi">http://esoteric.clanlib.org/~khirsch/windstille/Run.avi</A>
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; I think the head is coming down to fast when the front foot hits, what do you think?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; grumbel: about the story... Think if you want voice acting, perhaps make the boss a guy
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; mainly because women voices are limited :)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: that run needs quite a bit more work, arm position is wrong, hands should be much higher
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; not enough up/down of the whole body 
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; and the leg makes an unnatural quick leap forward
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; and overall it needs more speed
-
-&lt;line72&gt; hey, I have to run, is there a good place for me to get started with the code ?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; line72: <A HREF="http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Jobs">http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Jobs</A> has some small tasks every once in a while

-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; is it possible to jump so hight that you reach the upper board?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; however beside shaking the screen that might not be so usefull
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; WolfgangB: nope, but you can press left at startup then you land on the platform to the left
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; am planing to lowering/shrinking the platforms: <A HREF="http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-upjumpsketch.png">http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-upjumpsketch.png</A>

-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; anybody interested in implementing a quake-like console for windstille?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; would be of little use at the moment, but once we have scripting such things can be extremly helpfull
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; i have not looked at the code much, but i'll give it a try
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; so i can't predict how long it will take to create the console.
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; there is currently a little-output only thing available
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; now linuxtag is over i'll find more time to do coding :)
-
-&lt;egore&gt; WolfgangB: if MatzeB ports the sripting, you could use that for a console
-
-&lt;egore&gt; WolfgangB: did I miss much today at linuxtag?
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; no. maybe i had just bed luck choosing the presentations, but most of them were not that interesting :(
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; but i got a community ticket  so I can't really complain. 
-
-&lt;egore&gt; WolfgangB: hehe. Did you see the X.org presentation?
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; no, wrong plannig from Linuxtag there. x.org was in one of the smaller rooms, whe I arrived people where already standing in the doorways to watch the presentation.
-
-&lt;egore&gt; like the Xen presentation ...
-
-&lt;egore&gt; it started half an hour to early and the room could have been filled twice
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; but i looked at the exibition. x.org hat a nice demo with 4 videos plaing in transparent windows on the same desktop. another video as background.
-
-&lt;egore&gt; right, that looked great :D
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; grumbel, Of course you missed the LinCity-NG meeting. 
-
-&lt;WolfgangB&gt; ok, that was not an official event on linuxtag
-
-&lt;straver&gt; bye
-
-&lt;-- straver has quit (&quot;leaving&quot;)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; ok, meeting official over, i'll post a log

-Here are some of the things we discussed and decided on in our second IRC meeting:
-
-==Main Setting==
-The main setting of the game is a planet with abundant natural resources (gold?), and a semi-hostile environment.  People come to this planet hoping to get rich, and enter into the employ of various &quot;bosses&quot;, which provide them with equipment and land to mine, in exchange for a cut of the profits.  Bosses and their companies sometimes move from mine to mine - when they find a profitable plot of land, they may have to guard it to keep other bosses from moving in.
-
-Residential areas are organized into colonies, which are surrounded with electric walls to defend from hostile (unintelligent) aliens.  Miners are transported to the mines (outside the colony walls) by shuttle.  
-
-The society here is tough, but not overly hostile.  Most people carry guns, and disagreements are rarely settled by the police.  Communities have sprung up around the mining colonies, including bars and shops.  There is an interstellar government, but it takes a very laissez-faire attitude, and exercises little power on this planet.
-
-Interstellar travel is very expensive, and most people stay on the same planet for most of their lives.  No intelligent alien species have been discovered.
-
-==Plot Elements==
-The main character, Jane, lives on the planet for many years now. She came here like many others in the hope to get rich by mining. Now she works as a mercenary. She has modified her miner suit for combat installing some custom modifications and &quot;extras&quot; she got from a local dealer. She works for the character known as Boss, who employs mercenaries, but keeps the cover of a less interesting business (mining, or junkyard).
-
-The game will start with Jane recovering from a significant physical injury.  She doesn't remember exactly what happened (she had a blackout for some hours because of the shock at the incident), the boss knows what happened but tries to avoid the topic. This is basically a nice element to work on in a later release/episode, we shouldn't reveal it in milestone2. Jane is using a VR training program for physical therapy now (first mission in milestone2).
-
-Jane receives a mission from Boss to rescue a miner from a giant spider.
-
-==Random Stuff==
-The game, and the motivations of the characters, are driven mostly by money.
-
-Jane also has a nemesis.  At some point, this nemesis will rescue Jane.

-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; so who is new and wasn't there at the last meeting?
-
-&lt;dolphin&gt; I'm new, but looks like I've to go also :(
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; and especially who is seriously interested in helping of the newcommers?
-
-&lt;wonko&gt; i'm new... just listening atm :)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; I could introduce people who'd like to start with programming...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I wasn't here at the first meeting
-
-&lt;dolphin&gt; bye-&gt;
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: you want help with story, right?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; 89x128 
-
-&lt;paxed&gt; i'm just eyeballing, i probably won't have time to contribute much.
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; yeah
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; I'm interested in helping
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; Godrin: gave you svn access 
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; all those suggested helping with story I suggest to do a: wget -np -m <A HREF="http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-files/">http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-files/</A>
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; and browse through the content a bit
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: so what do you want to do?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; it contains plenty of ideas, sketches and stuff
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; those people with random ideas should use this page <A HREF="http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Ideas">http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Ideas</A> in the wiki to add their stuff
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; I'd like to help code, but I find picking up an existing code base to work on fairly intimidating, perhaps sticking to helping out with story
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; as far as the story is concerned, who's the minister of information?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; well you can always ask question and such to get into the code...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; you could also do simpler coding stuff like writing scripts or extending/maintaining the flexlay editor
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; (script are written in squirrel, editor mostly in ruby)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: the current story and sketches is done by me
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; grumbel is the main approver, since he does the artwork
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; are you also the creative mastermind?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; so all seminal ideas flow from you?
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; I'm capable of most things code wise, but I don't want to commit to anything big, since I probably won't find the time to do anything too big
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; if there are small, well defined tasks, I'll take a look at those
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: currently I am a bit out of ideas, but since I started windstille and was up until two weeks ago the only one working on it for the last few years, basically all stuff so far came from me
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ok
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; half of it shamelessly stolen or at least heavily inspired by other games I might add...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; all I meant is, do we come to you and ask about the backstory
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; or do we write backstory and give it to you?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; there really is not much back story at this point in time
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; so you could play a part in writing it
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; got ya
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: well getting the editor running again would be a well defined task...
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: have you written anything down of your story ideas?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: depending on your ruby knowledge this might be a small or big job...
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; grumbel: have some stuff at work I was playing with
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: I've never used ruby, but I hear it's based on Java?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: no
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: no, its more like python meets perl
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: it's more like python with different syntax
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; hmmm
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: with a lot of smalltalk in it
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; I changed the boss to a large black guy who is similar to that alien obi-wan kenobi goes and talks to in the restraunt in Attack of the Clones (for personality)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; for simple cases its really exactly like python, just with begin/end instead of indention
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: the editor currently is a base of c++ classes that can draw tiles and stuff
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: these can be used from ruby
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: so you would have to write ruby code to load levels and then some logic code to handle the gameobjects available
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: flexlay already has a well running supertux code which woudl be a good reference on how to do things
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; to me father-daughter dynamic is more interesting than girl-girl or mother-daughter dynamic
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; plus it's easier to get guys to do voices than girls :)
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; also, the boss you have is a young girl, and if you have ever worked with women you will know that women of the same age do not work well together :)
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; I couldn't get flexlay to compile last time I checked it out of svn, I'll give it another go though
-

-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; add least in the 3d models the boss-women looks quite a bit older then the other one
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: needs latest svn clanlib
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; grumbel: I did, finally, get that working
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: anyway, I don't mind changing the relationships a bit
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: just ask if you have problems getting stuff compiling
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; things might be broken in the svn versions
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; quickflash:  give me a quick flash of the story
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; or at least the characters
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; well, really there is only the 3 currently
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: I'll take a look and see what I can do, I wasn't checking it out with regards to windstille last time I looked, so I didn't spend too long trying to get it to work
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; hero is kinda non-descript.  Tough girl persona, she doesn't talk much unless it calls for it.  She never uses her sex to her advantage...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ok
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: I can give you a short intro to the map format later if you're going to work on this
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; boss is a big friendly black guy who is suprisingly agile, and somewhat cunning, but loyal to the people who work for him, even protective.
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; is he an office-type
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; or does he do field work?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; his cunning is well hidden below his extremely friendly demeanor, so the only ones who get a glimpse of it are his workers (the hero)
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: sure
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; if his cunning is hidden, he comes across as shallow?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; no, not shallow
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; just average
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; just willing to take advantage of a situation so long as no one he cares about gets hurt
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; a businessman
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; yes, but he's in charge of something mundane, like a junk yard, for cover
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ok
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; and he actually goes out and get's dirty working in the junkyard, because he's not afraid of work
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I think we were using different definitions of cunning
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; perhaps
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; intelligently taking advantage of a situation is what I would call it
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I was thinking &quot; Executed with or exhibiting ingenuity.&quot; as opposed to &quot;Marked by or given to artful subtlety and deceptiveness.&quot;
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ok
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; yes
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; and character #3

-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; #3 is the old boss
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; she is now a competitor that used to work for the boss but now went solo
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; retired?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; no, she's the same age
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ok
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; you drop that 3d models head a bit and she will look a lot younger :)
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; competitor = evil, or just annoying?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; more annoying
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; she's rather good, and the hero and her go for the same jobs
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; where did everyone else go?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; I'd say just normal hard business competition
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; me too
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; she's more willing to manipulate people though since she is on her own
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; evil for the sake of being evil is strange
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but evil to make money makes sense :)
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; hey!  It's everyone else!
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; economy-driven universe makes sense
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; everyone else is still here, just listening with interest
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but there has to be _something_ darker
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; not from those 3
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but we have 3 characters, and 0 story, so we can get to that later
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; is the structure for the RPG type stuff in windstille yet?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; maybe some jobs come from this &quot;darker&quot; side
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but the 3 shouldn't be directly involved in that
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; like an organization?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; well the one girl can be, the competitor MatzeB 
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; isn't the story just that you're trying to make enough money to get out of there?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; Team Rocket
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I can't believe I just said that\
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: I would like the basic setting basically completly harmless and non-evil
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; quickflash: well I typically find stories more interesting where the &quot;evil&quot;/&quot;Black&quot; side his hidden
-
-* SpoonMeiser slaps pifactorial 
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: the evil stuff is what those guys might run into later on
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I've gathered that
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; quickflash: just actting very indirectly through people like the competitor boss
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; yeah, I gathered that grumbel
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; who just execute jobs but don't actually know for what or whom
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; yes, but thinking of the competitor maybe unknowingly getting caught up with the evil stuff, but the boss keeps the hero out of it in the beginning
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but we have to know how the story ends before we start writing it
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Could the storyline be dependant on the jobs the player takes? So if he took &quot;bad&quot; jobs, he would eventually become a bad guy and fight the good guys?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; than maybe go to the point where the hero is saving the competitor
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; quickflash: the more unknown the evil is the more scary and interesting it is
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; mazteb, if I run configure with --enable-debug, will it disable optimization?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: only when you want it to be big epic stuff
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; MatzeB: yes I agree
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; quickflash: if you show the bad aliens or whatever right from the start that's plain boring
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; jamesg382: yes
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; ok, good
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; but only the boss really knows, he doesn't explain it
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: my plan goes more to tv-show like, so that you can add episodes wheneever you like
-
-&lt;-- AAAle has quit (&quot;Leaving&quot;)
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ok, I think I follow
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; if it's TV like than it will be truelly character based
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; dramatic, not epic
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; so we need more characters
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: let the competitor save the hero, more interesting
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; grumbel: yes, like that :)
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; heh
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; right on

-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; anyways, if it's eposodic, need to come up with more characters
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; there's the bartender already
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; how should he be like
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; if it's episode based, we're going to have to come up with unique, loosely-linked plotlines for each level
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; instead of one plot, split up into chapters
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: not for each level, but for each release
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; I fixed flexlay to work on amd64 :)
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ahhhhhhhhhh
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; well... compile at least
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: svn diff 
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: and send it to us
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; I mean I don't want to solve big fat mytsery at the end of milestone1(2) and/or blow the universe apart
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; want something I could build on later on
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; it's tough - do we want the bartender to be friendly
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; bartender is an information source, what would make him interesting?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; like the first star wars movie
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; it had closure, but not much
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; we don't need to know the bartender's background
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; Isn't the most important thing at the moment, to get the structure in place that will allow us to have story elements?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; no, but need a personality
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but his personality could add atmosphere
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; bartender should for most part somebody just doing its job, not necesarry friendly all the time, but not evil in any way either
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: from what I see it'll mainly be dialogs and scripting cutscenes inside the engine
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; kind of like most bartenders are in movies
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: but aren't there supposed to be 'adventure' areas, where you can choose who to talk to, which jobs to take etc?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I think the bartender has to be friends with hero though
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; mazteB, the game crashes for me when optimized but not when debug is enabled, did you say it was the same for you, too?
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; What's the setting of the story? Is that futuristic civilization fighting some other civilization? If so, that planet could be a frontier planet ocupied by both sides. The story of milestone 1 could end up with the hero freeing the planet from the ocupation of the enemy and it would still leave space for future stories.
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; friendly enough to give up information
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; jamesg382: quickflash had the same problem...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; whoa, coming in the middle
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: oh, and the fix to flexlay is just to add -fPIC to the compiler options
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; PauloMorfeo: no other civilization, no occupation
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; just economy
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: give him money, he will give you information
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; makes sense
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; so bartender is kinda cold guy who does a lot of listening?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; we can't have _too_ many friendly characters
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I'd prefer warm, but cold might be more interesting
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; you know, with an eyepatcjh
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; lol, nice sketch, grumbel
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; like the bartender in Monkey Island 2 :)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; the characters should be 'warm', but not so warm that everybody is necesarrily best friend of each other
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I was originally thinking like the Prancing Pony bartender from LOTR, but as I said, cold would probably work better
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; just bunch of people stuck on some dirty pile of colonie where they have to live with each other
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; Mazte, actually, worse than that: it crashes unless I am running it unoptimized, via gdb. So I guess something isn't initialized properly somewhere/
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; jamesg382: you know where it crashs?
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; everyone is trying to get enough money to get off the dirty colonie?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; what's your bt jamesg382 ?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; yes, money in itself can make for a boring motivation after a while
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; the backtrace when optimized is in the inline player get_state. there is no bt when not optimized because it doesn't crash.
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: some of them might be happy where they are
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; my error was with fonts jamesg382 
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: not everybody wants to live in all-happy StarTrek universe
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; I meant, get_movement_state
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; quickflash: but since these people aren't going to look back once they've gone, they don't really care about anyone else there?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; some like toget their hands dirty every once in a while
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; they have to care about each other, otherwise it just get's too &quot;mean&quot;
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; maybe the planet is in quarantaine or something, basically noone is allowed to leave it
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; hmm, the concept of a failing colony would be interesting though
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; I don't think it should be dispirited
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; so that we have a &quot;fixed&quot; universe for the story
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; MatzeB: that could be an idea
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Me away... Going to do something for my mother!
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; or getting tickets to somewhere else is simply really expensive
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; don't think we need quarantaine
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; my idea was more that mankind moved out into space and colonized a bunch of planets
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; or traveling needs 10years because you don't have faster than light travel :)
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; are we looking for an excuse to keep people on the planet?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; some of which turned up providing more resources than others
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; there needs to be some overall conflict that makes it interesting though
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; and this one is one with less resources
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; of course
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; even tv shows slowly reveal information to make it fun
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; why can't people just come and go from the planets?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; I'd like to have an excuse to keep people on the planet...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; we need some kind of motivation why Jane stays on this not so nice place
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; MatzeB: hunt for gold?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; needs something else besides resource gathering, because the people need to be conflicted between that and whatever else we think up
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; just like people move around here on earth
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; well, she doesn't stay there all the time
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; hmm gold hunt would be an interesting thematic too
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; she stays there because the boss is there
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; and she likes the boss
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; so the people on this planet are people hunting for gold and the bit of economy around that
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; (like the bars, shops)
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; they all stay there for that reason
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; Jane stays on the planet because that's where the company office is
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but she gets off the planet as often as possible to do missions
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; and the bosses actually &quot;own&quot; a bit of land that they can explore for gold?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; (maybe we should introduce a different material than gold...)
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; have you guys ever seen a bar where the same guys come everyday
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ahh, social structure
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; &quot;bosses&quot;
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; well, I don't have sunshine all the day where I live, doesn't mean that I suddenly move to the caribbean
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; maybe even feudal ;)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; so I don't think we need much to keep them there
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; that's the same reason they stay on the planet, it's there &quot;bar&quot;
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; grumbel: well gold hunt would be an interesting motivation
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I don't get it - obviously some people will stay on any planet, but why can't lots of people come and go
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; gold hunt is also good for introducing conflicts and twists into the story later
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: of course they can come and go
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: just we've been thinking in terms of a not so nice palce
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: so there has to be some motivation why people move there at all
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ok
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; and how hostile is &quot;not so nice&quot;?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; most planets would be very hostile, come to think of it
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; compared to any place on earth
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; half of them could simply be employes of &quot;big-evil company&quot; which were moved there to hunt resources
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; well staying with that gold hunt theme people wouldn't be hostile when they sit in the bar or so
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but when someone actually finds a bit of gold they'll start to be hostile
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; relocated against their will?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; or the usual fights about who owns which territories
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: well the typical gold hunter is a poor person
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: that has it's hope to become rich by finding gold
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: not against their will, its simply their job
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I think entire societies would form around the &quot;mines&quot;
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; like I hinted at earlier
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; maybe each mine is owned by a different &quot;boss&quot;
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; yes that would be a good idea
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but Jane's boss also does bounty stuff on the side
-
---&gt; wapee (~<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/windstille-commit">nobody at p54876984.dip.t-dialin.net</A>) has joined #windstille
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; and the gold mining is his cover
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; maybe the bosses provide material and machines for mining
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; and own the land
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but they allow the miners to work there
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; and get a cut
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; as long as they get 50% of the profits they make or so
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; bosses each run their company their own way
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; there are some stories floating around about people that have become really rich by finding alot of gold
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; while in reality the only ones getting rich there would be the bosses
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ahh
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; people come to the planet and get trapped
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; I'm not sure if we should do this as &quot;companies&quot; or more boss + 5 miners style...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; if we talk about companies I'm thinking about hundrets of workers...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: it's not really trapped
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; that's a tough one
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; depends on the sizes of the mines
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: it's just playing the illusion to them that they could get rich by finding lots of gold
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: there probably is a really small chance that this happens
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; maybe there are also some people who live there for a longer time
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; MatzeB: well, you know the scenario where they come to get rich, and then they are stuck there getting other people rich (but staying poor)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; who have understood that you can't get rich by doing this
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but they just live along with the small profits they make
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: yes that's what I mean with gold hunting
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: I just wouldn't talk of a &quot;trap&quot;...
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; well, being that it's the future you don't need as many &quot;human&quot; workers
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but I mean, most people can't even afford to leave
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; perhaps Jane isn't top of her game, and this is the only place she can currently find work? maybe she's new to this?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: they don't want to leave
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; might be a lot of robots per company, but like MatzeB's suggestion of maybe like 1 boss + 5 guys
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: has little todo with money
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; what's the story behind Jane's powersuit?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: if you have stayed there for years hunting for 'gold' you might actually start to like that place
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; robots or just futuristic mining equipment...
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; perhaps most places in the universe are the same, the living costs in the nicer places far too high
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; that &quot;powersuit&quot; could be the normal mining equipment
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: after all those workers there have build the colonie or a part of it
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; maybe Jane has done some personal modifications to it...
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: its @home
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; about the hostility of the planet - is it hostile because of people, or because of environment?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; make the powersuit something usually used for mining, but janes is modified for bounty hunting
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: like the A Team :P
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; to make it more usable for fighting
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: environment
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: not like making an A-Bomb from a trashcan in 5 minutes...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: more like fiddeling on it for years
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: every now and then a few hours after work
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ok so no need of evil bosses/companies that rule the planet with an iron fist
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I had the wrong idea
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; you can still have a evil company or many of them
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; yes
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; its after all a new born collonie so many parties will try their luck
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; what would make such a company evil?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I thought maybe the powersuit was a gift from Boss
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but the general feel of the planet isn't dystopian
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; using slaves to do their work?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; not caring about its workers
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; yeah
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; they can make more money that way
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; I would imagine that law enforcement would be weak in a new colonie, allowing the 'evil' people more opportunities in these places
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but is it dystopian or not?
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Back!
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; is it a happy place, or a hellish place?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: something in between I'd say...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; because &quot;somewhere in between&quot;
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; is kind of vague
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: you can live okay inside the colonie
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but it's not nice if you walk around outside the colonie
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; is the colony one of many on the planet, or does everyone live in the same place?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; in that you can't live long without such a miner suit
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; dome?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; there surely are some others I'd assume
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; always a good possibility to introduce new places/characters later
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; some dome type thingy might be there for air and protection against environment...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; are the settlements in domes or something like that?
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; About keeping people in the planet, it could be a directive of the empire. The Empire could determine that no one could change from the panet they lived in without permission, in order to control the population on the planets. So, we would have the workers coming to work on the planet and leaving when the comission was over, leaving the locals angry for wanting to leave also. We could have ilegal attempts to emigrate. We could have su
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; I hate to sound negative, but surely at the moment we just want to put in place the elements that will allow us to tell the story... have at least one 'walk around and talk' area, and linked with at least one 'powersuit' area?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; is there an &quot;Empire&quot;?  What's with inter-stellar government?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: current plan is VR training program for powersuit
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: the bar and janes apartment to walk around and get a first job
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; wouldn't make the planet that badly suited for humans
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; and a first job in a wood type environemnt with spiders...
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; pifactorial: is there an &quot;Empire&quot;? I don't know! Is there?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; just maybe hostile enemies out there or so
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I think they talked more about the engine last meeting
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; hmm yes
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: my point is, shouldn't we be discussing getting that section done then? we could talk about story, literally forever
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; that way we could do without expensive domes
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; you don't walk barefoot through the desert either, but it doesn't instantly kill you either
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but just with electro walls around the colony or so...
-
-&lt;-- koorek has quit (&quot;Lost terminal&quot;)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: this game should be for a lot of part based around the story, so its quite important
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; you need more safety equipment underground anyway
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; I prefer to see the cities as somewhat fortified places to keep nasty creatures from getting in!
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: currently we have good brainstorming, I'd hate to interrupt that now...
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: true
-
-&lt;-- Godrin has quit (Remote closed the connection)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: ie. more like, now we have a conflict between these and that party, how could they resolve it? and not, we have a gun implemented, who do we shoot?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; grumbel: so what about it?  Is there an Empire?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; it's also a good base to write interesting dialogs
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: there might be one, but its not really evil or anything
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; the empire might just not have much might inside the colonie
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; yeah, I would think lassez-faire
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; ie. it's there but they have nearly no milita/police there
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; a &quot;rim world&quot;
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; grumbel: is it going to be easy to implement the different game 'modes' wuth the current code though? seems that this might be a big job
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; letting the people settle their disagreements themselfes
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; that's why nearly everyone has a gun...
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; ok, via the tedius method of absolutely zillions of debug cout statements, I am now quite sure that is crashes at if (player-&gt;get_movement_state() == Player::DEAD), line 140 of game_session.cpp
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: it requires a bit of work, but its not rocketscience
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; jamesg382: I can take a look
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: I'd like to drive development by a story
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Will there be &quot;cut-scenes&quot; (or whatever you want to call them) or &quot;movies&quot; or something to present us with story elements?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: not drive the story by what the engine currently can do
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; PauloMorfeo: scripted cutscenes
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; ok, let's say this for the basic premis:  Space travel is expensive.  The current windstille planet is a mining planet.  There are many companies on the planet, and they mine for things in different ways
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; PauloMorfeo: most stuff should happen ingame
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; yeah
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; we already have the groundwork for I couple
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; some ways are high tech, some are not
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; btw is there some basics or is it mostly non-linear(well semi linear) type of game????
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; s/is/are/
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; PauloMorfeo: in-game as in in-game cutscene, not like now we switch to random render movie
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; I played &quot;Pachi el Marciano&quot; yesterday, it has some cartoon like screenshot instead of movies. It doesn't work bad!
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; @quickflash: Boss owns one of these companies
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; our hero works as a bounty hunter for someone who owns a say junking company.  
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; ruskie: its not linear, but not really non-linear either
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; I like the idea of driving development by a story, too, as long as everyone who is developing the story realises that due to technical constraints quite a lot of it won't make it into Milestone 1, if it makes it in ever. I.e., story si good for background and inspriration, even if much of it doesn't get used
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; as said semi-lineat
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; -t+r
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; ruskie: ie. you might change missions, talk with different people, but you want have simcity-like do whatever you want
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; it's a linear storyline with non-linear gameplay
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; or maybe it isn't ;)
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: if I'm being counter productive, just tell me to shut up :) but, we know that the story will call for walking around and talking to people, and moving between different game modes, my opinion is that we should work on getting that working

-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: we sure will
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: just most projects I did before had this story driven by the engine
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; most jobs involve in some way these other companies, either they need someone to help them get back to work, or in general they just need something cleared out
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: which is not good...
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; so how futuristic is this?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: I'd like to think of it as a movie
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: we wanna tell a story
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: not just show our special effects...
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; let's say there aren't too many bounty hunters on the planet, so jane always has a job
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ruskie: quite, rather
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; If it is going to be movie like, it must have a very non-linear story, me thinks.
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; PauloMorfeo: currently we're mostly talking about background setting...
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: yep, sometimes the companies might need capable motivated local people instead of their underpayed not always motivated workers
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; PauloMorfeo, semi-linear... yo uget to do linear missions I assume but pick them at random and so on
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ruskie: Alien-ish tech level I think
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: I agree, but we have a general idea, enough to get working on the engine with - changing scripted elements is likely to be easier to do later
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; grumbel: well workers just can't do it, they are workers, not warriors
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; will there be a concept of people &quot;owning&quot; land?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; will the bosses own the mines?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: that too
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; will bosses just get out and start mining at some place noone else mined yet?
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; hmmm I wouldn't go with bosses except where necesary...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; that
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; there should be mission objectives and such
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; that would allow some &quot;evil&quot; companies trying to take over mines that found gold...
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Does the planet have nasty creatures? If so, many of the jobs could revolve about rescuing some valuable equipment or person out of a mine that has been overrun by those creatures. Or maybe even overrun by pirates and bandits.
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: but sometime they simply might not want to do it, &quot;Hey, my contract didn't list that, no way...&quot;
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; how are we planning to introduce the VR tutorial? force players to do it, or have it as an optional 'quest', perhaps a hardware shop offers free powersuit orientation to customers?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; PauloMorfeo: yes, thats the plan
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; PauloMorfeo: <A HREF="http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-spider2.png">http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-spider2.png</A>
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: IMO we should make it so that you can complete it in 1 minute if you know how to control the character...
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; :p I missed most of the beggining of the discussion...
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; lol
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: thats where the game starts
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: farcry did that quiet nicely if you know the game...
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; MatzeB: how did farcry do it? know the game, but never played it
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; it basically instructed you how to get through the obstacles in the first level
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but if you already knew how to control it you just walked forward and were done
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; back to the question - do you make the suit, or get the suit?
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: wouldn't it be nice if a player didn't have to do it at all? but it was linked in via the 'walk about' game mode, like other missions?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: get it and improve it
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; they also introduce a small bit of story to make the tutorial interesting
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; so Jane is a merc...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; like mans watching you so you had to duck...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; grumbel: if that's the decision, then it's difficult to link the tutorial into the game

-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; how does the story start, is there a particular point we start with? something significant? or do we start with 'just anothre day in the life of Jane'?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: why so?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; I'd say another day...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; the monthly VR training on the schedule...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; because Jane already knows how to use the suit - she made it and has owned it for a long time
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; why does she have a training program?
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; The tutorial could hapen in home! We start at home and we get tooltips telling us what to do to leave home out to the town
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; to stay fit :)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: somebody improved the VR programm so that its now actually usable for suit training
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; hmm, that might work MatzeB
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: if say, she's coming back to work after being injured, or just starting employment with the boss, then we also have a reason why she might have to do the tutorial
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: or otherwise updated it
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; hmmm
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; I like the idea just starting the work
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; physical therapy?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: 
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: good idea
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; or maybe she's running the tutorial to test her latest suit modification
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; leaves the ability to improve the suit and other stuff...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; the idea of recovering from an injury is good
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; something like broke a leg a few weeks ago and has now to get back to work
-
-&lt;ruskie&gt; afk
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; had to be rescued
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; if we make it so taht Jane doesn't really remember what happened we have a nice element for later stories again :)
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; by her nemesis
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; mazteb, for some reason player == 0 in GameSession::draw
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; :D
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg382: player never inited, use Player::current() maybe?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; jamesg382: that might have to do with 1 of my hcanges...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; I'll check it
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; didn't know GameSession keeps another ref to the player
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; I wonder why it never crashed for me
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; seems like we're out of story ideas now
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; are there some details in this setting we missed?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; will someone summarize the setting and write it down?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; well, I think we have enough groundwork
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; that the story guys can start meeting
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; and set some stuff in stone
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; most important thing would be to derive some dialogs, cutscenes and first jobs from this setting...
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; I think it's not my fault, but if in Europe you are given a number in the form &quot;013-310330&quot;, then you type &quot;013310330&quot; and nothing else into the phone, right?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; yes
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; there is no - on the phone
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; indeed
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; jamesg382: svn should be fixed
-
-&lt;paxed&gt; it's usually an area code before the dash...
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; must jist be engaged or something
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; they are in the same area, I think
-
-* paxed is actually in an area whose code is 013 :P
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; grumbel: do you want to take the aspects of the story info we came up with and write that down?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: yes, we need to move that into the wiki
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; if you tell us what exists, we can fill in the dialogues
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; we just create the a whole nice setting here in irc
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Who here will be willing to do real voices into the game?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; someone would just need to place that in an logical order and write it down
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; PauloMorfeo: me
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; I can do 1 female voice and 2 male voices
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; lol
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; haha...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I don't want to know
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; you know someone female who would speak?
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; my wife does the female voice :)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; ah nice
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; I will do voices also if required! Nobody else?
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Everybody shy?

-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I would if somebody would ship me some recording equipment
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; well for milestone2 we don't have that many characters anyway...
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; I'll do the boss, have a voice for him
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: I used my builtin soundcard and a cheapo micro
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; I wouldn't mind but I'm not sure if I can get a mic to work with my PC, as the sound card only has a digital in. So if there are enough other people already I won't bother, but if you need more voice people, or if an English accent could be useful, I could maybe try to get my parents to send me one of my super-cheapo sound cards from hoem in the post
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: but works quiet well
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; hmm every character will have a different accent
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; heh
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; That's not bad! That is nice.
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; we want a pretty high standard for sound quality
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; which is hard if everybody's using a different mic
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: we could simply try it...
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; That might be hard... Keeping all voices with similar quality...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; it's worth a try
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: I added an experimental file to svn which I did
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; while sound quality might be a problem, getting proper voice acting itself done is also far from easy
-
-&lt;quickflash&gt; I'll do the voice mixing stuff too, I have some software that's nice for that
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; person with a mic doesn't make a good actor
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Sure is! How often we get a game with real voices...?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; yep
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; Sound quality is nowhere near as important with voice as with music. You have to really concentrate to tell the difference between a good mic and a bad mic with voice.
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; how you speak the stuff is important
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but if anybody uses homestarrunner.com, you know the low quality of Marzipan's voice, for example
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; what are the changes that need to be made to flexlay?

-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: need to decide on mapformat and implent that properly
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: then adding all the gameobjects, triggers and stuff
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; well should I do intro do flexlay now?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: mapformat will be based on lisp structures
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; grumbel: did you come to a decision from your HP forum post about tilemaps?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: that is you basically have a list that contain symbols strings, int, floats and other lists
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; maybe for voices we should have a single piece of text that everyone reads out and submits, and then we could discuss which voices are best for which characters?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; a trigger mmight look like this in this format:
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; (trigger
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt;  (name &quot;blup&quot;)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt;   (x 202) (y 100) (width 50) (height 59)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; )
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; is there a web interface to our svn?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; yes
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; moment...
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: yeah, I get the idea, similar(ish) to a hash in perl
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; jamesg382: sounds good to me
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: yes, going to use the first aproach, the classic one with 32x32 tiles
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: and then need automatic tile-adding
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/windstille/">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/windstille/</A>
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: and some way to mark edges
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; grumbel: soo we put in the impassable blocks, and the decoration is automatically added?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; good stuff
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: that's the current level in svn: <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/windstille/trunk/data/levels/newformat2.wst?rev=511&amp;view=markup">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/windstille/trunk/data/levels/newformat2.wst?rev=511&amp;view=markup</A>
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: the ground blokc is basically a list of properties and a (objects list
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; that contains all the GameObjects
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: half automatic I would say, ie. editor has a function to mark non-tiling tiles and automatically add decor tiles
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; GameObjects are TileMap, background images, triggers, spawnpoints, ...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; badguys other people
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; everything that is somehow on screen or forms a logical unit for gameplay...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; the thing that some people call &quot;Entity&quot;
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; in the engine we basically have 1 class per GameObject
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; this class has own loading code
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; you should model it like that in the flexlay editor as well
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; MatzeB, you sound like my boss
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; nice accent
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; heh :)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; well it's not a perfect recording yet
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but I didn't want to do it again after 8 tries
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but it's a good example
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; I just needed something for testing
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; oh man
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; the word ability has too much expression
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; as I had spoken it wrong 7 times before :)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; the &quot;suit&quot; also sounds a bit wrong...
-

-

-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; it's funny hearing British people try to do a Canadian accent
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; PauloMorfeo: 23
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; pifactorial: I can imagine
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; PauloMorfeo: yes it's a deep voice
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; PauloMorfeo: I'd like to speak some character that matches that
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; SpoonMeiser:  vice versa, I would think
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; we could make boss german
-

-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; :)
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Tha boss with tha german accent!
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; and I though the evil bosses are always french
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but that is probably after the movies have been translated :)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but if you think I'll be talking in nazi-accent, forget it ;-)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; this is no WW2 game...
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; I didn't knew nazis had a special accent...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; well in most english movies they surely have :)
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Anyway, speaking english, you'll hardly sound anything similar to a nazi accent.

-&lt;MatzeB&gt; things like &quot;Ah mein Leben!&quot; when they're dying...
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; I don't supose we have any scotish dude around? That would be fun!
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; you sound like the german guy who buys the powerplant in the simpsons
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: are you going to write down the background stuff from irc?
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; I can't believe I have a like $3000 PC and 4 state of the art mobile phones on my desk and a microphone and I can't work out to get my voice into my computer
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; if anybody here watches the simpsons
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; obsessively
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; :)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; everyone does :)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; but only the first few seasons ;)
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; MatzeB: I suppose I could, but I'm not sure I'm aware of the final decisions
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; or just a brainstorming summary?
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; And what about recording into the hard drive something that is going out to your PC speakers!? I've never managed to do that :S
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: simply do some or ask again :)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: I think we were pretty fixed on:
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - gold hunt athmopshere (maybe something else than gold)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - we're on a small mining planets
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - people get there in the hope to get rish
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Definetly something less common than gold, no?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - you have to work for &quot;bosses&quot; that provide you with mining facilities but you have to share your profits with them
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - the planet is a not so nice planet, but you can easily live and breath there
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - there is few police/law enforcement present
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; most people settle their issues with themselfes (that's why everyone has a gun)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - There is some economy around the miners, like bars and shops
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; ARG! I've worked out the problem! My microphoen is broken!
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - Jane will be the main character of the story she has worked as miner in the past
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but now is a bounty hunter or something
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - She has a modified miner suit
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; on which she added some weapons and more armor and other extras...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; She mostyle works for miner boss #1...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; In milestone2 we'll also meet the barkeeper
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; and eventually boss#2 that often is in competition to boss#1
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; <A HREF="http://www.fileuniverse.com/uploads/lada.mp3">http://www.fileuniverse.com/uploads/lada.mp3</A> Just as a note, that voice is not mine!
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - Bosses typically use a place on the planet and start mining there
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - If the mine has found gold you have to be carefull and guard the place
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; as other &quot;evil&quot; miners will try to overtake the mine
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; or people trying to steal the mined gold and such
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; though most mines only find small amounts of gold and are not interesting
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; Bosses typically switch mining places from time to time...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; There are other planets but we don't know much of them
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; Traveling is expensive and people mostly feel home on the colonie after living there for years
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; ok that's all I remember for now
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - windstille releases will have episodic character like a TV show
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; woo I got my microphone working!!!
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; - colonies just places where people live on the planet
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; there are electro walls around colonies
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; anybody posting that to the wiki as we speak?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; the story will start with jane recovring from some injury
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; she doesn't really remember what happened, just somethinge with a *type in text here*
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; this will not be revealed in milestone2 but in later episodes
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; she has to do the VR training program again because she was recovering
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; she talks to boss and gets a new job about retrieving a miner who has been lost in the wood or so...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; The miner will be captured by a big spider
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; how about this for the start of the story: intro is Jane as a miner, some mining accident occurs and Jane attempts to rescue her co-workers, game starts with Jane recovering from injury and boss recruits her into a new role of mercenary/bounty hunter/whatever?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; do mines exist inside or outside of colony walls?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: outside
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; there'll be shuttles that transport miners to the mines
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: how do we explain then that Jane has all the extras on her mining suit already?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: also I'd prefer not to tell from the past...
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: uhh... she's a hobbiest?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; only revealing this from time to time in some episodes
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: OK, that makes sense actually, not to get bogged down with history
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: well she does it for a living
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: but she likes working with electric stuff, tuning her suit
-
---&gt; bob4rrttt (~<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/windstille-commit">quickflas at c-24-14-62-112.hsd1.il.comcast.net</A>) has joined #windstille
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; SpoonMeiser: that's why I prefer this &quot;can't remember what happened on that accident&quot; thing...
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; MatzeB: So long as we don't have a cliched 'total amnesia' story :)
-
---- bob4rrttt is now known as quickflash2
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; not total amnesia
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; more like I remember that shuttle crushing on me...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but no idea how I got there and why...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but her boss or someone might be able to tell her later
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; it's just a few minutes lost in the mind
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; because of the shock
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; makes sense
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; any more techinical things people want to talk about?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; so will someone write this down?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; would be a good thing to get involved ;-)
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; ok
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I got a first draft in the wiki
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; <A HREF="http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/IRC_Meeting_2_Brainstorming_Summary">http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/IRC_Meeting_2_Brainstorming_Summary</A>
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; looks good
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; the windstille specific changes that need to be made to flexlay, should these be mentioned on the flexlay wiki, or the windstille wiki?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; as long as you link to them it shouldn't matter I assume...
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: windstille one is probally better, since thats where peoples focus is 
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; anything else to discuss?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; SpoonMeiser: unless you want to write some long interesting guide into flexlay that would be usefull for other projects as well, then thats better placed in flexlay wiki and linked
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; grumbel: in the windstille wiki then :)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash2: lets check the checklist :) <A HREF="http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Design_Discussion_CheckList">http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Design_Discussion_CheckList</A>
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; were 3d sprites discussed at all?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; quickflash: so far we mostly discussed about setting
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; quickflash2: so what about the 3d sprites?
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; are we planning on using them in milestone 1?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; quickflash: yes
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; don't see any reason why not
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; will we call this release milestone2?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; after all we already have one rotating around
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; as there already was some release...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; quickflash2: should be possible to get 3d chars working
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; wondering that as well
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; quickflash2: if we hit unexpected problems we can still go back to sprites
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; could be milestone3 from the number of releases, but then the first one was really 'basic'
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; milestone2 with version number 0.3.0 might be confusing
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; we could also simply give it a uniq name
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; well, I was working on the animations from an in game perspective, so using whatever method is going to be used by default would help a bit
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; like &quot;Windstille - The Beginning&quot;
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; making animations outside the game leads to some ugly animations- like the running one :)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; Episode One?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; that one has some baaaaadddd karma ;)
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; :)
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; man, I just recorded myself, I'd forgotten that my voice really isn't cool. Anyway, <A HREF="http://galaxyhack.sourceforge.net/rec1.ogg">http://galaxyhack.sourceforge.net/rec1.ogg</A>
-
-* SpoonMeiser shudders
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; quickflash2: I don't see how 3d sprites would look different from prerendered ones
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; jamesg382:  sounds good to me
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; it's more matching up the movements in player.cpp
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; jamesg382: you should probably speak a little slower...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; it's not Canadian English, but it's workable
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; jamesg382: Don't know what you're talking about! Sounds like a good enough voice to me!
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; yes, I did speak too fast
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; jamesg382: sounds pretty good
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; jamesg382 I like it
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Sounds like the voices of those dudes that comment those documentaries of wild life in Africa.
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; jamesg382: would make a good character
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt;  if you need a nature documentary presenter character, I'm your man
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; lol
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; jamesg382: it's not too fast if you ask me, it's normal for an english accent
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; well depends if a character speaks it it's probably ok...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; for background story it was a bit too fast for me...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but maybe that's because I'm not a native english speaker
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; At least that's easy to change. Just speak slower if needed... :p
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; grumbel: What's the story behind the name Windstille?  Is it the name of the planet?  Does it mean something?
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Is that word German?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; it's a german word
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: calm air
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; so is that the planet's name?
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Similar to english: Still Wind
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: no
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Name of girl?
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; lol Still Wind is an oxymoron
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; just a cool name for the game I assume...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: indeed :)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: its basically two things, a word play on Turrican which again is a word play on hurrican
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; but a nice one
-
-&lt;-- freed has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; oxymoron? What's that? It has anything to do with moron?
-
-&lt;SpoonMeiser&gt; I figured the link to Turrican
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: well in german it's not really an oxymoron
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; pifactorial: and in addition to that it refers a little bit to the amount of the athmosphaere in a sommer night
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I meant in english
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: it just means the state when there is no wind...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; <A HREF="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=oxymoron">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=oxymoron</A>
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; quickflash2: why do you need to adjust the animation to the game?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; quickflash2: is that in terms of speed of the animation?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; or how fast the character moves?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; might also refer a bit to &quot;Die Ruhe vor dem Sturm&quot; - &quot;silence before storm&quot; (or however you would translate that)
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; I need to see how they look in game
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; &quot;the silence before the storm&quot; - yeah, that's a saying in english
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; like matching the jump straight up to hanging and such
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; anyway the 3d sprites should mainly make it easier to get the sprites imported into the agme
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; and they would save some memory
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; in 2d you do it in pixels, 3d you do it with a vertice
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; yes, 3d is much easier :)
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; that's why I'm curious about it's priority
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; grumbel: are you actually working on the 3d sprites?
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; grumbel: I could take a look at them...
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; frame animations are missing from what I see?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; yep, animation are missing 
-
-&lt;netsrot&gt; What did he say in rec1.ogg?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; have a piece of proof-of-concept python script that gets the vertex data from blender animation
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; netsrot: I think it was not windstille related :)
-
-&lt;netsrot&gt; oki
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; ok I'll take a look then
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; jamesg382: what was that text from BTW?
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; ok
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; hmm, I guess I'd better go soon
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I'm hungry
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; but before I go
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; jamesg382: I remember some techno songs I don't like that had a very similar text...
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; does anybody here have experience with Ogre?
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; In English it is &quot;the calm before the storm&quot;, not &quot;the silence....&quot;
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; not really
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; jamesg382: I think I've heard it both ways
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; mazteb, it is the opening paragraph to War of the Worlds
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; MatzeB: let me commit some changes to the heroken.blend file
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; take me a few minutes, it's on the other computer
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; anyway, they're thinking about porting vegastrike to an ogre backend
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; <A HREF="http://vegastrike.sf.net">http://vegastrike.sf.net</A>
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: we just want to bring some vertices on screen
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; pifactorial: not use yet another big framework
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; no
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I didn't mean that
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I'm just recruiting
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; for the VS project
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; sorry
-
-&lt;jamesg382&gt; the top google link for &quot;silence before the storm&quot; is someone who has translated the German  &quot;Die Ruhe vor dem Sturm&quot;
-
-&lt;quickflash2&gt; &quot;the calm before the storm&quot; is the common english phrase
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; yeah, but it wins in a googlefight!
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; MatzeB: <A HREF="http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Graphics">http://windstille.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Graphics</A>
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; MatzeB: there is the snipped that does export the vertex data from animation
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; ah
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; I was searching it in the svn and couldn't find it :)
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; svn only has the mesh-exporter without animations
-
-&lt;grumbel&gt; needs to get a bit more complicated than that, since thats just supports a single mesh, while we might need multiple meshes
-
-&lt;PauloMorfeo&gt; Dudes, I must go! Bye all. Have a nice work, fun, or whatever you're gonna do!
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; yes should be no big problem
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; cu PauloMorfeo 
-
-&lt;pifactorial&gt; I'm gone
-
-&lt;MatzeB&gt; well we can finish the meeting now :)

-=== Advanced Lighting ===
-
-As mentioned in the HP forum thread, perhaps lighting similar to [[<A HREF="http://www.mechanicalcat.net/tech/ld48/6/bluescrn/diary|FUBAR">http://www.mechanicalcat.net/tech/ld48/6/bluescrn/diary|FUBAR</A>]], a game entered in a 48 hour programming competition (so it can't be that difficult) might add a lot of atmosphere.  Files [[<A HREF="http://www.mechanicalcat.net/tech/ld48/6/bluescrn|available">http://www.mechanicalcat.net/tech/ld48/6/bluescrn|available</A> here]].  I think it needs Windows, but obviously the lighting logic will be portable.

-=== Fist Fights ===
-
-The game is meant to take place on a rough outerspace colonie on a distant planet, so its more or less natural that conflict arises at times, a bit of fist fighting could help resolve that. The fight system should probally implemented as a mix of something like having a uppercut, a face punch and a belly punch and a block (in form of high, middle, low), either the animation itself should give hints on the oponents actions or DDR/Viewtiefull Joe like explizit markers.

I want something simpler and more mini-game like, more along the fights you get might get in some NHL titel (those EA Sports icehockey games), Indiana Jones or (even so thats kind of a different best) Zelda, ie. stuff where you can block, punch and maybe dodge but not much more. This should really just be for a little fight in the bar or so. No ground breaking boss fight.

-=== Mining Minerals ===
-
-The collonie will mine some minerals. One idea could be that these minerals could be used as fuel/energie source. Gameplay wise this could be used so that:
-
-* the player can recover energie from collecting minerals
-* minerals can detonate when you shoot on them
-
-=== Cargo Ship ===
-
-Every few weeks/month a cargo ship comes and collects the minerals:

-=== Some History ===
-
-Project report
-Colony #: 003456-A
-Company: Inviro Mining
-Manager: Nicholas Nantu
-Date: 2468-03-23
-
-The first ships have landed on the planet and have begun to setup the initial
-industries. The colonists have established 3 prime cities and have named the
-planet Windstille.
-
-As per our preliminary reports the planet seems abaoundant in plant and animal
-life as well as rich in mineral deposits.
-
-***CONFIDENTIAL***
-We have already issued orders to our group on the planet to claim as much of
-the land as they can before the others come.
-
-There however seems to be a base for pirates established on the planet. We will
-keep this information hidden for the time being. NOTE: We should hire a merc
-to solve this problem for us asap before it get's well known or out of hand.
-
-Current recommendation: DENY any and all pirate rummors.
-
-Our scouts report a spider like creature in the forrest that seems to be
-sentient. This is not desired since that would require us to re-locate to a
-different planet due to the colonisation laws.
-
-Current recommendation: hire a mercenaries to eliminate any and all sentients native to the planet.
-
-Mineral deposits secured(so far): gold, silver, platinum, uranium and an unknown mineral that seems to be highly concentrated with energy.

-=== Different History - Different Plot-take ===
-
-Our hero's location is a Moon designated SYS3991 3-1.  Orbiting a Gas Giant, piloting to the planet has always been difficult.  The Gas Giant produces large, powerful magnetic fields which protect the moon from dangerous rays emitted by the local sun.  The planet was found to be excellent from a source of minerals, but the magnetic field interferred with regular communications from and on the planet, making it unsuitable for normal human colonization.  The planet became marked as a frontier planet where the Goverment would only vest interest in the gathering of important minerals and, so long as there was a regular ship delivering materials, the goverment would not get involved within the way the planet was actually run.  The self formed goverment of the planet is loosely based on the companies that come and mine the planet.  The first company was the called the &quot;Local Miners Union.&quot;  Since then many companies have come and gone, each bringing various technologies to the pl!
 anet, but the Local Miners Union has been the only one to stay strong throughout.  A local militia was created that to help rid companies of any wildlife and creatures that interferred with their business.  The companies did not feel that a powerful militia was in their best interests, so the militia was so well funded.  The militia had to survive using old miners equipment that companies would leave behind when they left.  With the help of the recycling plant, they would modify the mining suits for use more in line with their work.  The head of the militia was a man named Donovan.

-Jane (our hero) was born on this planet, and orphaned as a child when her parents where killed in a mining accident. The circumstances of her parents' death had always been kept secret from her.  Yagor, the owner of the local recycling shop took her in as he usually did with any children left as orphans.  He and Jane grew a special bond.  Delilah, another child left orphaned by the same accident also came to stay with Yagor.  Delilah, while tough, was also always manipulative, and her and Jane never got along.  Delilah was jealous of Jane and Yagor's relationship.  At the age of 16, each girl went out on her own.  Jane joined the Local Miners Union.  Delilah joined the militia with the help of Yagor.
-
-At the age of 20, Delilah stayed behind on a mission due to a case a pneumonia.  While on the mission, everyone else in the militia was killed (Militia was around 30 people).  Everyone's body was recovered except for Donovans.  Once the militia was gone the companies on the planet decided not to try to rebuild a new one.  They felt that most of the planet had been tamed, and that only a few people where needed in order to battle any remaining local wildlife.  They therefore set up a mercenary system, where companies would just request help and pay per incident, instead of an annual subsidy.  Delilah quickly fell into the role of everyone's favorite merc.
-
-At the age of 21 Jane was not happy with her life.  Mining was in no way satisfieng her.  She saw the success that Delilah was having as a merc, and during her off hours started modifying her mining suit with the help of Yagor.  At 22 she took her first job as a mercenary, and by the time she was 23 she was doing it full time.  Now at the age of 25, her and Delilah are known as the best mercs in the business, and competition between them is getting increasingly fierce of late.  2 weeks ago Jane broke her foot.  Now she's doing Physical Therapy to help her recover.
-
-Some ideas on seperate stories that can be used:
-
-The local space goverment SYS3991 is in high need of titanium (or whatever).  Therefore they are offering a tax break on the company that produces the most titanium within a year.  This tax break counts across the whole galaxy, so companies that have never even entered the sector are on there way to start mining at SYS3991 3-1.  With these companies is coming new technology to the planet.  As people in these companies die, they recycle the new technologies, giving Jane (and Delilah) new power-ups to their suits.  The companies at first ignore each other, but after a while start offering merc jobs that interfere with one another's business.  This is not the first time this has happened, we find that the goverment made a similar deal 20 years ago.  At that time, merc jobs where offered against other companies, just the same.  We than come to find that Donovan used to do these types of missions while he was in the militia.
-
-The recent mining has upset the semi-sentient Regalis.  The Regalis have been attacking companies on the barriers more frequently. (Regalis are like Ewoks as far as brains go, but they aren't cute in any way)
-
-A new semi-sentient species (called the Verpasis) has been discovered, due to the recent mining.  They seem to be a spinoff of the Regalis species, except that they live deep within the planet.  The species seems to exhale a chemical that causes scary hallucinations within humans.
-
-3 mercs have shown up that work for one of the companies.  They have very good equipment, and often talk with Jane.  They do not seem to be antagonists to her, but they clearly want her to stay out of their way (which she respects as a fellow merc).
-
-In the end we find that Donavon is still alive.  He found the Verpasis 5 years ago, and discovered the properties of the chemical that they exhale.  He ended up killing all the others in the militia and then flying off the planet to find someone interested in using the chemical as a weapon.  That company got the local space goverment SYS3991 to start the tax break contest in order to build a mine in disguise to really export the chemical created from the Verpasis.  It is also found that Donavon was the one who killed Delilah and Janes parents.
-
-I'm sure we can add more to this.  Just think of little backstories that can intertwine within this.
-
-For episodic purposes, in the end we can basically state that the planet is mined out, so Jane and Yagor take off to find somewhere else to live...

-
-Grammar and spelling improvements.  The story is good, although needs a little more scientific checking (do magnetic fields interfere with radio waves?) and the species needs further development.  Could also do with moving from a conjecture tone to something more solid.  Currently the story is asking to be agreed with, rather than being told.  Also probably should go on a separate page.

-=== Backstory, Round III ===
-'''Just started throwing this together:'''
-
-Jane grew up on a planet in a system near to the Gold Planet (do we have a name?).  This planet is also a mining planet, but they mine common minerals, and the quality of life is low.  Jane grew up, like 95% of the other residents, in a mining family.  She worked with Boss as her supervisor (not actually a &quot;boss&quot; yet).
-
-One day, when Jane was a teenager, there was a collapse and the miners (including Jane) were trapped for many days.  Boss staged a rescue, and was surprised to find that Jane had the strength left to help with the rescue, even though many of her fellow miners were barely conscious.  He took a liking to her, and they forged a lasting relationship.
-
-Later, with the gold rush, Boss split off and formed his own mining company on the Gold Planet.  He invited Jane to come work for him, and she did.  Unfortunately, one of Boss' employees (nemesis) defected to another mining company, and gave away the security codes to Boss' mine.  When the miners returned to work the next day, they found the mine heavily fortified, and were unable to get in.  Boss lacked the resources to reclaim his property, and was forced into bankruptcy.  At this point, he started his junkyard.
-
-Although all of Boss' employees had abandoned him, Jane stayed loyal.  Instead of joining another mining company, she started to hire herself out as a mercenary to earn money, in hopes of rebuilding Boss' business.

-=== IRC-Discussion ===
-{{{
- &lt;netsrot&gt; Do you have any new ideas? =)
- &lt;netsrot&gt; will there be a stunngun?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; for the human-mode we will probally have plenty of non-deadly weapons
- &lt;netsrot&gt; nice
- &lt;grumbel&gt; don't wanna have much of a mass-murder kind of game
- &lt;netsrot&gt; Will there be smoke grenades?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; not sure how usefull they would be 
- &lt;grumbel&gt; but cheff granates might be in there
- &lt;grumbel&gt; not really sure how to handle the aiming
- &lt;grumbel&gt; with granates its probally best when one goes a bit into the direction of a yoshi island, ie. some kind  of cross or whatever that one has to target 
- &lt;grumbel&gt; for shooting i am not really sure what I want
- &lt;grumbel&gt; something more rpg like, something where you can actually miss without doing anything wrong
- &lt;grumbel&gt; need probally to have some shild or dodge system in place to allow the player some interaction
- &lt;grumbel&gt; want to have it more mini-game based
- &lt;grumbel&gt; ie. a shootout should play like a small game in itself, rather disconnected from the walking around
- &lt;netsrot&gt; oki
- &lt;grumbel&gt; for the powersuit mode however that needs to be kind of different, but even there I would prefer to not  have it to much metroid like 
- &lt;netsrot&gt; I know .
- &lt;netsrot&gt; More like a tank?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; not sure, but its something I am thinking about
- &lt;grumbel&gt; cybernator was a game that played pretty much like that
- &lt;grumbel&gt; ie. you played a huge battlemech, but it was all sidescrolling 2d jump'n shoot
- &lt;grumbel&gt; it was nice game, but powersuit here is a lot more lightweight, more a suit, then a mech
- &lt;grumbel&gt; question is really: you stand on a platform, some enemy in front of you, what do you do?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; should you need to duck to hit him if he is small?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; should you auto-aim when he flies?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; should you manually aim when he flies?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; should you be able to aim at all?
- &lt;netsrot&gt; I think not
- &lt;netsrot&gt; You should always aim forward or up?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; should I be able to run and shoot at the same time?
- &lt;netsrot&gt; Yes but you should aim very bad?
- &lt;netsrot&gt; Possibly shoot yourself in leg if unluckey =)
- &lt;netsrot&gt; Should there be walk/run mode?
- &lt;netsrot&gt; And walking backwards?
- &lt;netsrot&gt; Will there be any kind of knockback system?
- &lt;netsrot&gt; When getting hit or something.
- &lt;netsrot&gt; grumbel: still here?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; yep, still there
- &lt;grumbel&gt; just programming a bit while talking
- &lt;netsrot&gt; nice =)
- &lt;netsrot&gt; knockback would be nice if there is falling dammage on enemy.
- &lt;grumbel&gt; getting hit should definitivly give some feedback
- &lt;grumbel&gt; not just a drop of energie
- &lt;netsrot&gt; good
- &lt;grumbel&gt; at best it should be something special, say some badguy might bight you in the leg
- &lt;grumbel&gt; or ram you or capture you with tentacles
- &lt;grumbel&gt; or attack you visually by other means
- &lt;grumbel&gt; if you throws some acid/poision at you it should fly in a balistic curve, not linear
- &lt;netsrot&gt; Will there be somethig like cars?
- &lt;netsrot&gt; s/somethig/something/
- &lt;netsrot&gt; I would like a running dropkick move =)
- &lt;netsrot&gt; giving the enemy a long knockback =)
- &lt;grumbel&gt; there will be a dropship that brings you to whereever you need to go
- &lt;netsrot&gt; oki
- &lt;grumbel&gt; cars probally in the background or so, not sure what they should be good for gameplay whise
- &lt;netsrot&gt; You could have bigg guns on it =)
- &lt;netsrot&gt; But thats probably a bad idea.
- &lt;netsrot&gt; Will it be possible to distract an enemy or set up traps?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; distraction yes
- &lt;grumbel&gt; traps not sure, maybe mines or so could be usefull
- &lt;netsrot&gt; Will there be binoculars?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; maybe
- &lt;netsrot&gt; IR goggles?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; they would be a bit weird in 2d 
- &lt;netsrot&gt; I have seen them work in a never released 2d sidescroller
- &lt;grumbel&gt; ir or other kinds of vision most likly
- &lt;netsrot&gt; but it used maps like in worms1
- &lt;netsrot&gt; Will there be some kind of maps over the levels?
- &lt;netsrot&gt; World map/starsystem?
- &lt;grumbel&gt; there won't be a worldmap, because there won't be levels
- &lt;grumbel&gt; but there will be a level map
- &lt;netsrot&gt; oki
- &lt;grumbel&gt; there will also be some overview map, but not in the supertux-kind of way
- &lt;grumbel&gt; more like a real map that you see on a terminal
- &lt;netsrot&gt; ok
- &lt;netsrot&gt; Pherhaps it will be areas instead of level?
- &lt;netsrot&gt; and sectors
- &lt;grumbel&gt; official name currently is 'sector'
- &lt;netsrot&gt; oki
- &lt;grumbel&gt; which can be basically anything from a large outdoor areal to some small back room in the bar
- &lt;grumbel&gt; something different: I also would like to a have a resident evil like inventory
- &lt;grumbel&gt; something where you can look at close-ups of your items, rotate them and stuff like that
- &lt;netsrot&gt; That would be nice.
-}}}
-
-=== Escaping ===
-
-Most games your 'you against the rest of the world' and in the end you win. How about situations in Windstille which you can't win? In which you have to run for your life and just barly make it?
-
-Good idea. For example: There could be an assassination attempt from other mining companies resulting in an explosion in a mine Jane is in. She has to run to find the exit and her Mission obivously fails this time. There could be other events like this.
-
-Or more like it you're attacked by an insane number of enimies, and you have to retreate fighting and doging just to save your skin :)
-
-=== City ===
-
-It would be nice if the city you walk around in non-powersuit mode had a slightly living feel to it, like Syndicate or GTA or whatever. Obviously our extremely limited resources mean anything even resembling a true living city is impossible, but some ideas to heighten the feel of a real city might be:
-
-* NPCs who exist only to provide back story and hints, who you don't actually need to talk to to progress
-* Being able to travel via train or subway rather than just by foot. You wouldn't actually control the vehicle or anything, it would just be an animation for when you go between different areas
-* It might be nice if there was stuff going on in the background, though this is probably never going to happen. E.g. if you are at a shuttle port then shuttles take off and land in the background, if you are at a train station trains come and go in the background
-
--- ----
-
-Here is a Screenshot to give the player a bit more feeling of walking in a big city (just added a few dots with a big effect): [[<A HREF="http://people.freenet.de/almightymagnus/blubb.JPG">http://people.freenet.de/almightymagnus/blubb.JPG</A>]]

-== Episode 1 ==
-
-=== Intro/Tutorial ===
-
-There was some discussion during the IRC meeting about how to work the tutorial into the story.  I was thinking it might make sense to open the game with a short cut scene where Jane is trapped and her suit badly damaged, and then the training takes over from there, with a dialog with a mechanic character which both introduces plot and explains the game mechanics.  Something along the lines of:
-
-Mechanic: Man, your suit really took a beating down in that mine.  What the hell were you doing down there?
-
-Jane: (Boss) sent me down there to meet someone who was interested in our services, but he didn't give me much detail.  I'm going to go find out if he knows any more than he told me.
-
-Mechanic: Before you go, could you help me test your suit?  I've got everything repaired.
-
-Jane: sure.
-
-...
-
-Mechanic: Why don't you start by climbing onto that block over there
-
-Blinking Overlay: To climb, press Jump and Up together
-
-...

-== Enemy Ideas ==
-=== Swarm Enemies ===
-
-Instead of simply using a bunch of almost men-sized enemies the game should feature a bunch of swarm-enemies, ie. very little enemies that act as a collective, fighting against them with normal projectile weapons will be pretty much impossible, instead the player has to either utilizie the flame thrower or destroy the swarms nest (if available).
-
-== Items and puzzles ==
-
-If the game is to be a little bit more thoughtful and slow paced than an out-and-out shoot-em-up, perhaps it would be nice if there were a whole bunch of items and objects in the game world, which have to be combined in the right way in the right places to progress?
-
-Grumbel has sketched some ideas out at:
-
-[[<A HREF="http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-files/puzzles.png">http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-files/puzzles.png</A>]]
-
-Combining the item/puzzle related ideas from the above sketch as well as some thoughts of my own, here is a list of possible item/object comination puzzle ideas:
-
-* you have to push or pull a crate/box or multiple boxes into position to climb over an obstacle, or to gain access to a ladder
-* doors, walls, boxes or other objects that stand in your way could be destroyed with guns and/or explosives
-* explosive barrels can be placed next to a wall and then blown up to destory the wall
-* a bad guy has a powerful machine gun or whatever and you have to duck behind game objects to avoid being hit, but can shoot him when he stops to reload
-* press a button to make a lift go up or down
-* press a button to connect/disconnect a bridge
-* ladders
-* monkey-bar style traversing of ravines
-* zoomed out aiming with sniper rifle or missile launcher or other very powerful weapon to take out very dangerous enemies from afar
-* keycard doors
-* forcing people to do things at gunpoint
-* using a torch to light up/find items in darkness. Perhaps certain enemies don't like the light and would try and creep up on you until you shine your torch at them, and which point they scamper away
-* EMP grenades could take out automated weapon systems or very powerful robot enemies that are otherwise next to impossible to defeat
-* hacking into computers to control doors, lifts, automated weapon systems, robots, etc
-* destroying a power generator to allow you to get through an electrified fence, or to stop automated weapon systems from working, or to intentionally pluge a sector into darkness
-* an aqualung or similar that is needed to dive underwater
-* stealing or forging an identity card to gain access to a restricted area
-* radiation suit to go in a radioactive area
-* sabotaging a train or shuttle using a toolkit
-* putting a tracking device on a shuttle

-
-== Fog of War/Visibility ==
-
-Not sure if we need it, but might be helpfull to limit visibility to things that are currently in the players view. For example it shouldn't be possible to look through the roof.
-
-
-== Voice Acting Script ==
-
-I think the script could use some work, but maybe my tastes are different, so I figured I'd post a sample of how I'd have written what's in the Plot section and if folks feel it's better, I'd be happy to handle it:
-
-Intro:
-
-The Big Boom.  Humanity found out it could travel to the stars, and it did, en masse.  But it didn't take long for it to turn into The Big Bust.  The guilds, the governments and the corporations staked out the best worlds.  Still, many more took their chances, even without military hardware and terraformers.  Most worlds were so barren, or dangerous, that whole colonies died out.  In the Free Colonies that survive, life isn't easy.
-
-(I like, first of all, to detach from concrete dates, and try to imagine how people would come to refer to an era--in this case the obvious connection is between The Big Bang and The Big Boom.  This also establishes four major classes of humanity: Guild, gov't, corp and free--which I think affords some good storyline and gameplay aspects.)
-
-This is my new home, Sys-triple-three-nine.  The locals call it Hellas.  There are only two real jobs in the colonies: miner and merc.  I tried mining--bouncing from planet to planet, trying to find  work.  Then I met Yagor and he told me I could make more money in one mission as a merc than I could make in a year as a miner.  That was about six months ago.  It's like any other job, really, you have good days.. and bad days.
-
-First Mission
-Boss[4]: &quot;Hey, you feelin' re-coop-er-ated?&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;I think so, why?&quot;
-
-Boss: &quot;Not sure exactly, somethin' at Jimbo's.  Do me a favor, head down and see what's up.&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;I'm on my way.&quot;
-
-(Jane grabs her jacket and leaves her apartment and goes to Jimbo's bar, just a few screens away)
-
-Jane: &quot;Hi, Bob.&quot;
-
-Bob: &quot;Jane! I thought you were dead. Looks like one of our boys got into trouble. He ended up trapped in the nothern forest.  We got the emergency call half an hour ago.&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;Doesn't Northern Star take care of this?&quot;
-
-Bob: &quot;Don't ask me, ask them...&quot;
-
-Miner: &quot;Are you kidding? I'm gonna risk my neck for that poor bastard? Only an idiot goes into that forest.&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;I can't believe you'd just abandon him there!&quot;
-
-Miner: &quot;What do you care?  You're just a damn mercenary.&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;I guess I can't expect much from a drunken miner. Anyway, I'll find him.  Where was he when he sent the distress signal?&quot;
-
-Bob: &quot;Here ya go.  You know NorStar can't pay much... &quot;
-
-(Communicator call from Boss)
-
-Boss: &quot;Got something?&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;Everything's set, boss, looks like we have a job. Come and get me.&quot;
-
-Boss: &quot;Okay, meet me on the roof.&quot;
-
-(Jane goes to the roof and enters the spaceship, piloted by Boss)
-
-(little cutscene that shows spaceship flying over to the northern forest)
-
-(Jane gets dropped at the forest)
-
-Boss: &quot;Ok Jane, this is as far as I can bring you, you have to make the rest on your own. I'll stay in contact.&quot;
-
-: I think that's mostly OK, except:
-: 1. Only Americans say &quot;niner&quot;. If an American is doing the voice over of Jane, then OK, but otherwise it's just a pointless Americanism
-: 2. I don't know about using the word &quot;bastard&quot; - I guess I don't really mind, it just swearing in a game almost always makes it looks more childish than more adult
-: 3. I hate the phrase &quot;Have you know honor?&quot;, noone in real life would ever say that, ever, it sounds like Fantasy-RPG-talk.
-: -- [[User:James Gregory|James Gregory]] 22:43, 5 Aug 2005 (BST)
-
-I never realized the niner thing (Being an American) though I do think it's more natural to say things like, 'triple-three', rather than simply stating the numbers.  I tend to agree with the stance on cursing (That it can come across as juvenile), unless it's pulled off naturally (Again, being an American, cursing to me lends an air of realism, but it can easily be ditched).  The 'have you no honor' line is crud, I agree, but I thought the idea of a certain disdain between miners and mercs would be interesting and I could think of no way to prompt the miner's response (Which I like).  Perhaps just a simple, &quot;Don't you care?&quot; to which the miner could respond, &quot;You kill people for money and you're lecturing me on morals?&quot;  (Though it'd need to be modified idiomatically--that doesn't sound quite how I'd imagine a miner to speak)
--Meeks
-
-::Just a note - AFAIK &quot;niner&quot; was coined during WWII to avoid confusion with the German word &quot;nein&quot;.  As of today, it is still the standard of the FAA and ICAO.
-::--[[User:Pifactorial|Pifactorial]] 11:55, 7 Aug 2005 (BST)
-
-:::I didn't know that, however, the fact that the dialog says &quot;triple three&quot; indicates that the dialog is casual, and not air-traffic-control speak. -- [[User:James Gregory|James Gregory]] 16:23, 7 Aug 2005 (BST)
-
-:: Yep, I like it as well. I think the 'bastard' sounds fine in the context of a drunken miner, the honor-thing might be a bit over the top. Another thing, Bob should only be barkeeper and informant, not the one to pay, so 'we can't pay much' is wrong, should be Northern Star who pays.
-:: -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 23:50, 5 Aug 2005 (BST)
-
-:Okay, I changed it around a bit (Kept the 'bastard' for now--I think that the actors will change the script in little ways when they think it doesn't sound natural, so it can get dropped if it sounds silly).  I thought about making it 'Sys-triple-zed-niner' just so we could get both sides of the Atlantic in on the action, but I dropped it.  It's a rather silly trick, but we should consider having different real-world accents for the various different in-game groups (In the way that all the officers in Star Wars were British).  Otherwise, just let me know a scene overview and I'll write the script for it.
-:-Meeks
-
-: I like it, and even made a short test intro using the first few lines of text. Whilst doing so, I found the following very small style points slightly different to how I would write, not sure if it matters:
-: 1. &quot;Staked out&quot; is usually an almost-synonym for &quot;being closely watched&quot;, yet here it is being used to mean something a bit different
-: 2. &quot;Still, many more took their chances&quot; should probably be &quot;Still, many individuals took their chances&quot; to differentiate what we are talking about in contrast to the organisations in the previous sentence
-: 3. &quot;Most worlds were so barren, or dangerous, that whole colonies died out&quot; - getting really nitpicky now, but the commas in the sentence seem unneccessary. If I say that sentence out loud I don't include any pauses. Perhaps &quot;Most worlds were so barren or so dangerous that whole colonies died out&quot;?
-: -- [[User:James Gregory|James Gregory]] 01:40, 7 Aug 2005 (BST)
-
-:I like this version but I would like to add some comments.
-
-:: 1. Jane has not been introduced with any depth. Some form of character or character flaw could come across fairly strongly straight away to help us identify with her. Maybe there could be some humourous banter rather than &quot;I guess I can't expect much from a drunken miner.&quot;
-
-:: 2. Nobody would call their home Sys-Triple-Three-Nine. More likely would be &quot;This is my new home, Hellas. The Corporations would call it Sys-Triple-Three-Nine&quot;.
-
-:: 3. Too many pleasantries reduce the pace and the atmosphere. Maybe cut out:
-
-::: Jane: &quot;I think so, why?&quot; (and collapse the two Boss lines so that he's not expecting a reply)
-
-::: Jane: &quot;Hi, Bob.&quot;
-
-::: Bob: &quot;Don't ask me, ask them...&quot;
-
-::: Boss: &quot;Got something?&quot; (Instead, Jane should make the call)
-
-:: 4. The line &quot;Ok Jane, this is as far as I can bring you, you have to make the rest on your own&quot; feels weak. How about &quot;Ok Jane, this is as close as I can get you. The distress signal is coming from just under a klick North-East.&quot;?
-
-: -- Dan &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/windstille-commit">mauve at mauveweb.co.uk</A>&gt;
-
-:: I'm not so sure about points 1 and 3, it seems pretty good as it is to me.
-
-:: -- [[User:James Gregory|James Gregory]] 02:17, 7 Aug 2005 (BST)
-
-: Some comments about the intro text: I don't like Big Boom and Big Bust, just sounds wrong to me, probally better to not name those events or give them some more subtle names, something that doesn't jump out of the text so much. I also find the seperation in different classes far to strict, governments are by that time probally mostly the pets of the cooperations and guilds sounds too much fantasy-RPG. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 11:32, 7 Aug 2005 (BST)
-
-:My inspiration for the guilds was the Spacing Guild in Frank Herbert's Dune, so I think that the inclusion of that style of organization has a good, non-FRPG basis.  I also think that even if we decide corps are the superpowers, that there would still be governmental types and (Even if they are weaker than the corps) the people in the governments would still be different from corporate guys.  Maybe that's part of their characterization, too, in that government agents will act high and mighty but weild little real power, or constantly be superseded by corporate agents.  Finally, since this is a voice acting script, I feel it's necessary to iterate that the script is malleable, such that comma placement and individual word choice (And in some cases, whole phrases) can and should be adapted by the voice actor to whatever their interpretation of the character.  That said, it seems like people are comfortable with me writing the script (And providing editing commentary, which i!
 s welcome) so now I need to know what else needs to be written. -- Meeks

-== Tasks ==
-
-The following tasks are available, make sure you check with [<A HREF="irc://irc.freenode.net/#windstille">irc://irc.freenode.net/#windstille</A>] IRC Channel first to make sure that those tasks are not yet compeleted or picked up by somebody else, since those task lists always tend to get outdated quickly.
-
-As always with [[wikipedia:Free Software|Free Software]] game projects, no payment, all for fun, reputation and experience.
-
-=== Blender ===
-
-* rig the powersuit-character and the powersuit-less characters properly (data/blender/hero.blend)
-* create proper animations for walk, run, jump, duck, turn-around, aim and shoot, simple sloppy test animation would for the beginning be enough, just to figure out the movement and timing
-* make sure all animations are exported and available in the game
-* discuss what sort of bad guys will be needed and create models for them
-* you will move between levels in a transport ship, this requires a model (or maybe a 2D based sprite instead?) - this needs to be discussed and made
-* animations for going stairs up and down, [[<A HREF="http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-stairs-2005-07-17.png|stairs">http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-stairs-2005-07-17.png|stairs</A> look like this]]
-
-=== Sound ===
-
-* We have none at all currently doing sound effects. If you want to do this, please get in contact
-* Voice acting. We have probably quite a few male volunteers for voice acting, but possibly not many female volunteers. However, we cannot start organising this until later in the development process, because dialog has yet to be written, let alone finalized
-* Wansti is making some music. If you want to write music too, join the IRC channel and coordinate as to what is and isn't already being done, etc
-
-=== Major features the game engine is still missing ===
-
-* Jumping and grabbing on to things, climbing on to platforms
-* Firing weapons
-* Fist fights
-
-=== Various bit-sized C++ tasks that require no particular knowledge ===
-
-* fix bugs - you can find some in the [[<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/windstille/trunk/BUGS?view=markup|SVN">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/windstille/trunk/BUGS?view=markup|SVN</A> BUGS file]]
-* integrate all available animations
-* boxes or other items that you can push and pull
-* initialising/loading/saving script variables (this is already being worked on by JamesG and MazteB)
-* implement stairs, see blender task list above
-* implement an elevator a platform onto which one can step on and once one presses 'use' it moves up or down, if 'use' is pressed while its moving it should inverse the direction
-* change the console so that each expression that returns a value automatically prints it
-* implement the currently unimplemneted function in the particle system
-* change the Sprite3DDrawingRequest so that it does *not* make any use of the Sprite3D class itself (sprite3d::Data should be ok), because this causes throuble if you want to draw a sprite3d twice with different parameters
-* implement some form of particle/spring system so that you could attach a lamp to it or something like that
-* add layer support to particles, so that you can have particles on the light layer
-* we need a way to define objects in scripting language, nothing complicated, just so that when you want a lamp you don't have to specify its light/color/highlight layers over and over again seperatly
-* add Origin support to Sprite (much easier to say 'center' instead of (-32, -32))
-* add support for resolutions other than 800x600, for the scenario itsef it simply means to change the scaling, but fonts and such could require some more clever way to scale so that they don't get blurry
-* implement load on-demand (ie. load everything the sector needed at start of the sector) for TileFactor
-* Blender Sprite3D exporter seems to have throuble with the Yagor, body gets messed up, when head and body are joined on the other side everything looks ok
-* implement screenshot support
-* save configuration changes only on request (probally via option menu), not at default on game quit (ie. to avoid switch to fullscreen -&gt; find out that fullscreen doesn't work -&gt; quit game -&gt; stuck with game in unworking fullscreen mode)
-* add ability to use different textures in 3d sprite to skin somebody with different cloth, show damage or such
-* find out what broke the animation in latest SVN, either the .blend file itself got broken, the exporter (since it got restructed by Grumbel) or something else
-
-=== Pretty OpenGL effects ===
-
-* firing weapons - machine gun, flamethrower, etc
-* implement water that has waves
-* add a player-holding-torch lighting effect
-* write a GameObject/Entity that simulates a 'laser display' or however you call things like [[<A HREF="http://www.laserist.org/Laserist/2003Awards/LFI_Static_Cubi%20Bubi_B.jpg|this">http://www.laserist.org/Laserist/2003Awards/LFI_Static_Cubi%20Bubi_B.jpg|this</A>]], ie. something that uses a laser to project a 2d vector object on a wall, color of the laser should be configurable
-* remove the players light sprite and replace it with a scripted entity, something analog to the fire-particle effect that attaches to the player
-* fix nightvision to handle highlights correctly
-* implement moths or other little insects that fly around street lamps or other things
-
-=== Random tasks ===
-
-* write a Squirrel-mode for Emacs
-* bring all include file guards into the form of (except those of seperate libraries like lisp/ and squirrel/):
- #ifndef HEADER_{SUBDIR}_{FILENAME}_HPP
- #define HEADER_{SUBDIR}_{FILENAME}_HPP
-
-=== Editor (written in Ruby) ===
-
-* update it so that it can handle current file format completly and let it be tolerant to tags he doesn't know yet
-* add handling of unknown GameObjects (stuff their sexpr into a object and write it out on save)
-* added a tile editor that allows to edit the tile definition file
-* find out what broke redo/undo
-* write a .sprite file parser in ruby
-* integrate the color picker component with GenericDialog
-
-=== Into the future: ===
-
-* face animation via morph targets to be used in dialogs, by no means important for the GotM run, just something Grumbel would like to have one day

-A Windstille level or sector needs to hold multiple tilemaps, some meta information, object placments and information on the background and the triggers/scripts. S-Expressions will be used as textbased-format, if necessary  there might also be a compiled binary format, but textbased formats have shown to be very flexlible in the develompent procress, so we start with them first.
-
-There are three default tilemaps, 'foreground', 'background' and 'interactive'. 'interactive' is the one on which the player walks normally, 'foreground' is for stuff infront of the player, 'background' for tiles behind the player, both don't have any impact on collision detection.

-Realistically, milestone 1 is only going to be able to have a very limited number of locations. This is an attempt to keep track of what locations we actually intend to create  - which requires art, level design, coding the required game objects, populating the location with characters and bad guys, and including the location in the plot.
-
-== VR Training ==
-
-* Used for the opening tutorial for the game.
-
-* provides a number of sub rooms to allow the player to train all kinds of stuff
-
-== City ==
-
-* Jane's apartment
-
-This is where the game opens. Perhaps it could be reused for other things, too?
-
-* Street / roof tops
-
-Maybe we will have a sector that just represents walking about the city? I don't know.
-
-* Bar
-
-Used for meeting some of the characters, perhaps you may go here for jobs, or whatever.
-
-* Train station
-
-Maybe this isn't needed, but we have a train model and train stations are a good location for meeting characters and travelling, and they also add to the feel that you are in a living city.
-
-* Shuttle port
-
-Where you get on shuttles to take you away from the city
-
-== Forest ==
-
-This is where the Milestone 1 powersuit mission takes place.
-
-* Above ground
-
-Will contain trees, and maybe some swamp or something too. The idea seems to be that on the forest surface your enemies are the local wildlife, not humans or aliens or whatever. The final boss is a huge spider (though they could be put below ground, see below)
-
-* Underground
-
-Both man made mines and natural labyrinth. Quite possibly it will contain some robots of various sorts for bad guys, perhaps also spiders.

-Windstille is planed to be an 2D action-adventure game along the lines
-of games like Flashback or Metroid, but it isn't intended as a direct
-clone from either of those. The gameplay will be divided into
-bascically two modes. In one the player walks around without his
-powersuit, thus he is limited to realistic human abilites. This mode
-is used to travel around in the city, talk to people and get jobs. In
-the other mode the player has equiped his powersuit and is out in the
-wild exploring new terrain, foreign planets and such which wouldn't be
-explorable without the suit. In both modes the player will be able to
-use weapons, in the former however much less often then in the later.
-
-
-== Story ==
-
-The game takes place in the distant future when mankind has developed
-faster than light travel and began colonizing the galaxy, building up
-industries and city on other planets. While some of those colonize
-live in wealth others have quickly run out of resources and are now
-struggling for survival. The game starts of in the later kind. Where
-the player takes the role of a yet nameless mercenary which is trying
-to make a living on one of those planets. See [[Plot]].
-
-== Engine and Graphics ==
-
-The engine is coded in C++ and uses ClanLib. It currently works in
-800x600 by using OpenGL. Tiles come currently in 64x64 and there is a
-particle engine, however not yet integrated into the
-game. Lightmapping is supported by the engine. Sprites should be in
-3D, but are currently 2D. There is a level editor, in the form of
-Flexlay, that however would need quite a bit additional work. There
-are 3D models for the powersuit and the hero without the suit.
-
-
-== Missing Pieces ==
-
-Basically most parts of the gameplay are missing, there is no real
-collision detection in place, there has been zero work on the human
-movement and the animations of the powersuit are also better to be
-redone from scratch. There is some scripting support in place, however
-that is based on Ruby and should be replaced with Squirrel
-
-
-== Milestone 1 Goals ==
-
-The goals for the first Milestone would be:
-
-* create a virtual reality look alike mission that teaches the player the use of the powersuit:
-** [[<A HREF="http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-virtualreality.png|Virtual">http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-virtualreality.png|Virtual</A> Reality Artwork]]
-* create a small part of the city including a bar where the player finds is first job:
-** [[<A HREF="http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-level.xcf|Gimp">http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-level.xcf|Gimp</A> XCF sketch of a level]]
-** [[<A HREF="http://windstille.berlios.de/artworks.html#scenery|Some">http://windstille.berlios.de/artworks.html#scenery|Some</A> close up sketched of possible scenarios]]
-* have the first real mission play in a forest like setting:
-** [[<A HREF="http://windstille.berlios.de/images/screenshot6.jpg|screenshot">http://windstille.berlios.de/images/screenshot6.jpg|screenshot</A> of forest setting]]
-* write proper dialog and story
-* some more info is available at:
-** [[<A HREF="http://windstille.berlios.de|Official">http://windstille.berlios.de|Official</A> Webpage]] (information on the official webpage however might be outdated and inaccurate)
-
-== Game Mechanics ==
-
-When without the powersuit you can:
-
-* walk
-* run
-* duck
-* jump, 3 tiles wide when staying, 4 tiles when running
-* jump-up to grab on a ledge or the like
-* roll

-This page is meant to show what has been decided so far. Please add dialog/script for new plot to the [[Ideas]] page rather than editing this page directly. This page already goes into the actual dialog, if you want a broader overview, go to the [[Plot Events]] page.
-
-When you are writing your new plot on the [[Ideas]] page, take account of the following:
-
-* Take account of the characters available at the [[Characters]] page, possibly we could create more but try to use existing characters where possible
-
-* Take account of the locations at the [[Locations]] page, as with characters we could create more but try to use existing locations where possible
-
-* Take account of the various debates about the background context of the story at the [[Ideas]] page and from the [[IRC Meeting 2 Brainstorming Summary]]
-
-We need plot to explain why the character is going from location A to location B, why they are talking to character D before shooting some stuff in location F, etc. You can add epic background stories of love and betrayal to the [[Ideas]] page if you want but what we really need is some down-to-earth gameplay plot.
-
-Some sort of process will take place whereby we agree on which ideas to use and which not to use, which ideas require new engine functionality and which must be discarded because they are too ambitious, etc. Here is what has been tentatively decided so far, though any and all of this is still up for debate.
-
-== Overview ==
-
-In general windstille should have episodic character. That is each release will feature a new small episode of the heros live, similar to weekly TV soaps :) This should match the open source development style better than having a huge epic story in 1 big release.
-
-== Background ==
-
-The game takes place in the distant future when mankind has developed faster than light travel and began colonizing the galaxy, building up industries and city on other planets. While some of those colonize live in wealth others have quickly run out of resources and are now struggling for survival. The game starts of in the later kind. Where the player takes the role of a yet nameless mercenary which is trying to make a living on one of those planets.
-
-The intro will go something like:
-
-Jane: &quot;Its the year 2248[1], after mankind has developed faster-then-light travel they have begun colonizing other planets and building up industries on other planets in the search for usefull good, one could call it a second gold rush. Some say mankind has spread faster then good for them, others hail the technological progress. Some colonies have become quickly abandoned after no worthy goods have shown up on a planet, other flourish at the same time and some struggle for their survival. This story takes place on one of the struggeling colonies, resources are rare and goods are seldom, the people struggle for their survival, but most of them like it that way.&quot;
-
-- View on the Planet -
-
-Jane: &quot;This is Planet SYS339-3, my planet, moved here after I got sick of the mining business. Always moving from planet to planet just turned out to be less fun then expected, so I tried to settle here, build up a new live. Had a hard time in the beginning, but once I meet Yagor. Have worked for him now for like 6 month and things started to get better had a bunch of fun in the job till that one day...&quot;
-
-- Cutscene of Jane getting hit/bitten whatever and getting wounding and then dragging herself to the next opening in the forest to be found by the shuttle. Tilemap for this should be all black, so that only Jane is visible.
-
-- Fadeout
-
-Jane: &quot;Have been out of work since that day, can't really remember what happened. All I know that I broke my leg and lost a lot of blood, wasn't that much fun and pure luck that 'Pilot' found me in time. Recovery took a while, but tomorrow is now my first day back in the job. Yagor wants me todo VR training first, he doesn't seem to trust my abilites anymore, well, guess a little bit VR training can't after beeing out of order for a while.&quot;
-
-- Cutscene of Jane entering the VR-chamber
-
-- VR gets activated
-
-AI: &quot;Welcome Jane, long time no see. Good to have you back.&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;How about we stop talking and start training, show me what you got.&quot;
-
-AI: &quot;Ok, I have prepared a few programms for you, Yagor wants you to start with the first one, so lets go&quot;
-
-ControllDialog: &quot;Press left/right to walk, press up to enter a door&quot;
-
-Player enters with Jane programm 1 door
-
-AI: &quot;First programm is just a little bit jumping and running, have prepared a little course for, see those gems (camera scrolls around and shows the scenario), try to collect them all.&quot;
-
-Player can now move around in the level to collect gems, ControllerDialog shows the keypressed that are required to complete a specific obstacle.
-
-(text runs out and the game fades over to the apartment of Jane, where Jane is just doing a VR training in her new powersuit)
-
-== Virtual Reality Training ==
-
-VR Training shows the player what actions are available and how to use
-them. It does this by guiding the player through a little course where
-he needs all the available actions to make it to the end, an AI-voice
-will explain the player what to do. A little meta-game control help window will tell the player which exact buttons he has to press to perform an action.
-
-# Walking: the player is commanded to walk from his current position to a marked new position
-# Running: the player is commanded to walk from his current position to a new one, the way is however bloked by a conveyour belt which he can pass without changing to running mode
-# Jumping: the player has to jump over a small abyss, if he doesn't make the jump he will get reset to a position infront of the abyss
-# Climbing: the player has to make a 'hang-jump' (Up+Jump) to climb onto a little mountain
-# Duck: the player has to make its way under a block, under the block is a conveyour belt, so ducking will let him glide under it
-# Rolling: same as above but this time the player has to run and then make a roll under the block, optionally this might also be done with sneaking
-
-After movement training is over, the VR Training will switch over to weapon training, where the player has to grab a gun and use it to shoot a bunch of dummy targets (double-pyramids or something like that). Also available should be grenades, satchel charges and shield.
-
-== Back in Real World ==
-
-(onces done with the training Jane takes a shower)
-
-(seconds later her communicator starts to ring)
-
-(Jane dresses up and leaves the shower to take the call)
-
-Boss[4]: &quot;Hi Jane, looks like there is some throuble up in the bar.&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;What's it about?&quot;
-
-Boss: &quot;Not sure exactly, but might be a job for you.&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;Ok, on my way.&quot;
-
-(Jane grabs her jaked and leaves her apartment and goes to Jimbos bar,
-just a few screens away)
-
-Jane: &quot;Hi, Bob. Whats up?&quot;
-
-Bob: &quot;Jane! Long time no see. Looks like one of our mineral-hunters got into
-trouble. He moved deep into the nothern forest and got trapped, we
-got the emergency call half an hour ago.&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;Doesn't Northern Star take care of this?&quot;
-
-Bob: &quot;Don't ask me, ask them...&quot;
-
-Miner: &quot;Hey, what did you expect from us? We already underpaid, don't wanna risk my neck for that poor bastard. He should have known better to stay away from that forest.&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;Don't you have the slightest idea of comradeship?&quot;
-
-Miner: &quot;What'd you know lady?&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;Hrmpf, guess I can't expect much of those drunken guys. Anyway, I am in, let me know his last position.&quot;
-
-Bob: &quot;Ok, here you go.&quot;
-
-(Communicator call from Boss)
-
-Boss: &quot;Got something?&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;Yep, everything is set, looks like we have a job.  Come and get me.&quot;
-
-Boss: &quot;Okay, lets meet on the roof, will be there in a minute.&quot;
-
-Jane: &quot;Yep&quot;
-
-(Jane goes to the roof and enters the spaceship, piloted by Boss)
-
-(little cutscene that shows spaceship flying over to the northern
-forest)
-
-(Jane gets dropped at the forest)
-
-Boss: &quot;Ok Jane, this is as far as I can bring you, you have to make
-the rest on your own. I'll stay in contact.&quot;
-
-== Forest Action Sequence ==
-
-The forest is full of creatures, some/most hostile and agressive,
-nobody really knows where they did come from, but rumor is that they
-are caused by some genetic material which was spread over the forest
-as a cargo ship of the Bio-Corp[7] crashed into the forest, however
-that incident has never been confirmed officially and since it
-happened in the early days of colonization no proper record of the
-happenings is available and truth to be told, nobody really cares
-anymore, people have other problems these days.
-
-(Jane now goes hunting down the forest, shooting spiders and other
-animals that cross the way)
-
-Automapping and regular radio messages guide the way through the
-forest.
-
-The level will play both above and below the ground, the below-ground
-sections will allow to greate labyrinth like structures, which the
-above ground only allow in a rather limited fasion.
-
-
-
-(Final boss is a large spider into which net the mineral-hunter has
-fallen)
-
-(to be continued)
-

-The following roadmap should give a little guide in which order stuff will be developed, so that it can be tested and integrated without to much stepping over each others feed. The main goal is to create a fully playable Milestone 3 (Version 0.3.0) release in the next few month (something around three might be accurate).
-
-The following items should be more or less developed in that order, so that progress is visible and we won't end up with a completly unplayable version inbetween:
-
-* create 32x32 tiles for the virtual world
-* switch the engine back to 32x32 tiles
-* rewrite the currently fully broken collision code to properly handle tilemap - player collisions
-* add support for multiple sectors
-* add/cleanup the dialog support 
-* integrate squirrel scripting into the engine
-* write 'story' for the tutorial, ie. simply a AI that will tell the player how to control the game
-* create the levels necessary for the tutorial
-* create an additional level for the tutorial in which the player can train their movement in free form
-* create all necessary animations for the hero
-* finialize the story and the needed settings for the actual game
-* create all the necessary character 3d models for the actual game
-* do the graphics for the house/base of the hero
-* do the graphics for the powersuit scenario
-* write the dialog for the game
-* create the sound effects for the game
-* create music for the game
-* do the voice over for the game
-
-The following items can be implemented basically as soon as somebody finds the time:
-
-* add slope support to the tilemap
-* add stair support to the tilemap
-* add support to push boxes around
-* add support for carring and stacking boxes
-* add support for multi-layer playfields (ie. rooms that you can enter, which cause the wall to fade away)
-
-== Releases == 
-
-Release 1.0.0 should be a fully playable and complete version, releases before that should be playable as well and should contain at best a self contained story. Development releases/technical previews should be seperated from the playable released and should provide a special interface which lets you select level, intros, etc. The init/intro screen should show that the current version is not playable.

-C++ functions are exposed to scripts via the interface in the &quot;scripting&quot; sub directory&quot;.

-Each sector/level is stored in an sexpr based .wst file. This contains tilemap layout, trigger locations (doors etc), spawn locations of bad guys, NPCs and the player character, as well as various other things. At some point thse will be editable using the [[<A HREF="http://flexlay.berlios.de/|Flexlay">http://flexlay.berlios.de/|Flexlay</A>]] tile/level editor, though this doesn't work correctly at the moment.
-
-The plan is that scripts can then be associated with these .wst sectors, or indeed with individual bad guys or objects within these sectors. Multiple scripts can be run simultanously. Some examples of things scripts might be used for:
-
-* to alter the starting locations of bad guys, NPCs or the player character, or stop any one of these from spawing at all
-* to alter which trigger points are active, or to alter their locations, or what they do
-* to control the AI behaviour of bad guys or NPCs
-* to control dialog with NPCs
-* to control when and where new information is provided to the player

+C++ functions are exposed to scripts via the interface in the &quot;scripting&quot; sub directory&quot;. Miniswig, found in the &quot;tools/miniswig&quot; subdirectory, is a tool that creates wrapper functions to allow the interface functions to be called from squirrel. If you have bison and flex installed then miniswig will be built automatically, and any changes you make to the scripting interface will automatically be added to the wrapper functions when you execute jam.
+
+Each sector/level is stored in an sexpr based .wst file. This contains tilemap layout, trigger locations (doors etc), spawn locations of bad guys, NPCs and the player character, as well as various other things. At some point thse will be editable using the [[<A HREF="http://flexlay.berlios.de/|Flexlay">http://flexlay.berlios.de/|Flexlay</A>]] tile/level editor, though this doesn't work correctly at the moment.
+
+The plan is that scripts can then be associated with these .wst sectors, or indeed with individual bad guys or objects within these sectors. Multiple scripts can be run simultanously. Some examples of things scripts might be used for:
+
+* to alter the starting locations of bad guys, NPCs or the player character, or stop any one of these from spawing at all
+* to alter which trigger points are active, or to alter their locations, or what they do
+* to control the AI behaviour of bad guys or NPCs
+* to control dialog with NPCs
+* to control when and where new information is provided to the player

-While Windstille tries to be somewhat original, however there is are obviously some games that have been a huge inspiration.
-
-== Another World ==
-
-One of the most athmosperic games ever created, it has tons of little details, birds in the background, a lion like creature that will watch you in the background for a few screens and will attack you only moments later. Its basically 100% scriptbased, meaning no screen will play the same as the one before, something that makes this game rather uniq and sets it apart from basically all other platformers. Fighting against enemies works either by using the environment, ie. drop huge objects on them (cage, crystal ball) or by using a laser weapon which has three modes, normal shoot, shield and a wall-blasting supershoot. The mode is selected by charging the weapon for a given amount of time.
-
-== Flashback ==
-
-Still probally one of the best animated games ever, especially the later levels where you travel around in a city had quite a bit of influence on the 'human-part' of Windstille.

-
-== Persian Gulf Inferno ==
-
-Can't really remember much about this game, but the general look was somewhat similar to Flashback.
-
-== Metroid ==
-
-Obviously a heavy inspiration for the powersuit part, however Windstille should try to be quite a bit slower, making the action more real and less jumpy. Metroid Zero Mission actually also contains a short 'human-part', where you have to survive without your powersuit, however that is not all that well executed, looks for most part like a sneaking-game (MetalGear), but actually is just run and hide with the enemies since one simply can't actually 'sneak'. Still is worth a look, video is available [[<A HREF="http://ia200100.eu.archive.org/hdc1/items/MetroidZM_2850/MetroidZM_2850_part4.avi|here">http://ia200100.eu.archive.org/hdc1/items/MetroidZM_2850/MetroidZM_2850_part4.avi|here</A> (forward a minute or two to get to the human-part, its from a speedrun, so it doesn't exactly represent normal gameplay, but it gets close)]].
-
-== Turrican ==
-
-Turrican is obviously inspired by Metroid and so Windstille is also inspired by Turrican. Originally, meaning the first few days/weeks of development, Windstille reused some Turrican gfx as fillers.
-
-== Cybernator ==
-
-A 2D Sidescrolling mech game, looks somewhat similar to Metroid, but plays *much* slower, since you really are controlling a huge mech and not just a person in powersuit, quite unlike basically every other 2d side scroller.
-
-== Mission Elevator/Elevator Action ==
-
-Rather obscure reference, however was probally the first 2D game that had a somewhat 'realistic' environment, or at least the first one I touched.
-
-== Other similar scrollers ==

-Some questions concerning the collision handling:
-# Should we use constant or increasing speed, while pushing/pulling boxes ?
-# Moving the player avatar is done in constant speed, yes? I've not compiled the game yet.
-# What about elasticity - do we need this?
-# What about pushing more than 1 box? Should this be prevented?

-&lt;&lt;/ind&gt;&gt;

-&lt;&lt;ind:1&gt;&gt;
-The most important point is that the GameObjects get proper feedback on collision, which object collided with which other objects, at which side, what speed had the other object when the collision occurred, at which exact point in time the collision occured and such. How to react on that is then the job of the GameObject, for most GameObjects physical behaviour is not usefull, it would be just a 'nice to have' for the few cases where one wants stacked boxes and such.

-
-&lt;&lt;ind:1&gt;&gt;
-About the box example: You should use normal impulse equations, so this would result in the box increasing it's speed and it would also allow pushing multiple boxes. Elasticity is in general not needed I think.
-
-Another important part of the phyiscs/collision stuff would be to handle slopes correctly.

-Some more questions:
-# As I see, there is already some nice collision demo in test. I think I'll integrate this with the old way collision is done with the tilemap, ok?
-# As Jane isn't really box-shaped, should we part here into several boxes? That would mean linked boxes, which share speed, force and mass. And that leads to the question how to get these boxes. Maybe we should stick to one box, but that has the drawback of bad collision detection when shooting.

-There are actually two seperate collision engines in Windstille, completly forgot that I already started the first one after starting the second one a few month later. The second one is in test/physics/ with the jumping boxes and the first one is in collision_manager.cxx and ctest.cxx (last file needs to be recovered from svn history), the first one doesn't do physics but has some API that handles the collision events, which is much more important than jumping boxes, jumping boxes are something that should be implemented ontop of a proper collision event system, not the other way around. 
-
-Another thing that isn't handle by either of those is what I call 'attachments', ie. when you are standing on a moving platform or a conveyour belt you are attached to it and navigate in its coordinate space as long as you are attached, thats something that the physic/collision/entity engine would need to handle as well, so that one could mark objects as attachable to other objects

-Some news on the collision detection. I think I've found a solution for the 3-box-problem falling on each other. After doing the actual collision detection a constraint-assurance-algorithm is run in each frame. This algorithm does push colliding objects from each other till there is no penetration or a maximal count of tries is reached. This seems to work ok. Now I need some more time to fix some problems with slopes and implement this unstucking for combined collision-objects.
-I hope you can cope with some more delay on this, as I have very limited time. The current code can be found at: <A HREF="http://www-users.rwth-aachen.de/David.Kamphausen/collisiontest_050629.tgz">http://www-users.rwth-aachen.de/David.Kamphausen/collisiontest_050629.tgz</A>

-= Drawing Operations =
-To bring images on screen you have to execute drawing operations. There are several different types of drawing operations. Each of them depend on a number of parameters.
-
-== Common Parameters ==
-These parameters are used for all drawing operations
-* Position, Rotation, Scale -- These 3 values together are called a modelview transform and are encoded as a 4x4 Matrix
-* Color -- the color is multiplied with each pixel that is drawn
-* blend_sfactor, blend_dfactor -- factors that are used for blending pixels with alpha values on screen (see glBlendFunc for details)
-
-== Text ==
-Writes text on the screen. Parameters:
-* Font -- The font that is used to write the characters (the font has additional attributes like color of the text)
-
-== Surface ==
-Draws a 2d bitmap (called Surface) on screen. Parameters:
-* Surface -- a pointer to a surface (a surface contains the opengl texture handle and uv coordinates)
-
-== Sprite3D ==
-Draws a 3d model on screen. See Sprite3D class for more details. Parameters:
-* Sprite3D -- the 3d sprite that should be drawn
-
-== VertexArray ==
-Executes a drawing command for opengl primiteves. (Typically used for GL_QUAD and GL_TRIANGLE)
-* texture -- texture handle of the opengl texture
-* type -- opengl primitive type
-* vertex list
-* normal list (optional, specified per vertex)
-* color list (optional, specified per vertex)
-
-= State Model and Transform Stack =
-When looking at typical code that does drawing operations, one observes that the
-common parameters are often the same for several drawing operations. It is convenient to 
-not have to specify all parameters again and again for each
-drawing operation. So we created a state machine that maintains a &quot;current&quot; value
-for each of the common parameters.
-
-You can also observe that most of the time the things you want to draw are
-given in a local coordinate system only. Typically you apply a &quot;camera&quot;
-transform to them or have even deeper parent/child relations where the
-coordinate system is relative to the parent. These cases can nicely be handled
-by a stack for the Position, Rotate and Scale attributes. Positions, Rotations
-and Scales are now specified relative to the topmost stack element. You can now simply push
-the transformation from child coordinate system to parent coordinate system on the stack
-and draw all childs in their own coordinate system.
-
-= Foreground/Background and Z-Positions =
-We're presenting a (pseudo) 3d dimensional world on a 2d dimensional screen.
-Handling Foreground and Background requires us to sort the Drawing Operations
-so that stuff in the foreground is drawn after stuff in the background and
-obscures the background.
-
-It's very difficult to enforce a certain drawing order in the code, so we're
-introducing the concept of a z-position. DrawingOperations with higher
-z-positions will be executed after drawing operations with lower z-positions.
-This means that we can't execute the drawing operations imediately anymore, but
-we have to store the information needed to execute them. We call this info a
-Drawing Request. We fill a list with all Drawing Requests and sort them
-according to their z-positions and finally execute them in the correct order.
-
-= Implementation =
-The basic block of the implementation is the DrawingRequest class. It stores all
-information needed to execute a drawing operation. You can create custom subclasses from this class and override
-the draw() function to execute your custom drawing operations. You can expect
-that all common parameters that are maintained by the DrawingContext are already
-setup when the draw() function is called.
-
-The DrawingContext class is responsible for the state management and maintains
-the modelview transform stack.
-
-= Optimisations =
-To correctly implement the drawing operations we have to create snaphots of the
-current drawing state and append it to all DrawingRequests. You can observe that
-for most drawing operations in a typical scene these snapshots contain identical
-values except for the position.
-
-So we factor out the modelview and color+blendfunctions used in DrawingRequests
-to point to a shared block that is used by multiple Drawing Requests. This not
-only reduces memory consumption but also allows for more efficient restoring of
-the drawing state in opengl. As we can now compare the pointers of the
-ModelView and color+blenfunc objects and only reset these values if the
-pointers are different.

+not have to specify all parameters again and again for each
+drawing operation. So we created a state machine that maintains a &quot;current&quot; value
+for each of the common parameters.
+
+You can also observe that most of the time the things you want to draw are
+given in a local coordinate system only. Typically you apply a &quot;camera&quot;
+transform to them or have even deeper parent/child relations where the
+coordinate system is relative to the parent. These cases can nicely be handled
+by a stack for the Position, Rotate and Scale attributes. Positions, Rotations
+and Scales are now specified relative to the topmost stack element. You can now simply push
+the transformation from child coordinate system to parent coordinate system on the stack
+and draw all childs in their own coordinate system.
+
+= Foreground/Background and Z-Positions =
+We're presenting a (pseudo) 3d dimensional world on a 2d dimensional screen.
+Handling Foreground and Background requires us to sort the Drawing Operations
+so that stuff in the foreground is drawn after stuff in the background and
+obscures the background.
+
+It's very difficult to enforce a certain drawing order in the code, so we're
+introducing the concept of a z-position. DrawingOperations with higher
+z-positions will be executed after drawing operations with lower z-positions.
+This means that we can't execute the drawing operations imediately anymore, but
+we have to store the information needed to execute them. We call this info a
+Drawing Request. We fill a list with all Drawing Requests and sort them
+according to their z-positions and finally execute them in the correct order.
+
+= Implementation =
+The basic block of the implementation is the DrawingRequest class. It stores all
+information needed to execute a drawing operation. You can create custom subclasses from this class and override
+the draw() function to execute your custom drawing operations. You can expect
+that all common parameters that are maintained by the DrawingContext are already
+setup when the draw() function is called.
+
+The DrawingContext class is responsible for the state management and maintains
+the modelview transform stack.
+
+= Optimisations =
+To correctly implement the drawing operations we have to create snaphots of the
+current drawing state and append it to all DrawingRequests. You can observe that
+for most drawing operations in a typical scene these snapshots contain identical
+values except for the position.
+
+So we factor out the modelview and color+blendfunctions used in DrawingRequests
+to point to a shared block that is used by multiple Drawing Requests. This not
+only reduces memory consumption but also allows for more efficient restoring of
+the drawing state in opengl. As we can now compare the pointers of the
+ModelView and color+blenfunc objects and only reset these values if the
+pointers are different.
