 Windstille ToDo
 ===============
+
+Scripting
+=========
 
+* Currently we wakeup on conditions that are broadcasted to all
+  scripts, in some situation it might make more sense to attach the
+  script directly to the object that sends the signal
+
+* some functions in scripts require '::' before them so that they can
+  be found, not quite clear why or exactly when this happens
+
+* objects are currently all exported to squirrel, while we should
+  probally use id-tags and accessor functions instead:
+
+  bob = get_object(&quot;barkeeper&quot;)
+  bob.say()
+
+* player can launch PDA or inventory when in a dialog, this will break the script
+
+* currently the ScriptManager is global, meaning scripts are never
+  cleaned up on Sector changes, this needs to be fixed
+
+* figure out proper 'namespaces' for the scripting, i.e. gfx_ or
+  video_ for all display related stuff and so on, so that
+  tab-completion works better and things become more readable
+
+* document scripting tricks somewhere:
+  spawn_object(&quot;shockwave&quot;, {pos=[0,0]})
+
+* conversations really should be data with hooks for scripts, not pure
+  scripts
+
+* print and println behave different on console
+
+Input Handling
+==============

+* implement proper dead-zone in input handling

+* allow to load multiple controller config files at once

+  change their volume by other means
